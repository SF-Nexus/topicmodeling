deluge, and before the deluge another race, whose nature it is '\n"," 'not for mankind to understand. Not unearthly, not alien, for this was their '\n"," 'earth and their home. There was a war between this race, which was a great '\n"," 'one, and another. The other was truly alien, a sentient cloudform, an '\n"," 'intelligent grouping of tangible electrons. It was spawned in mighty '\n"," 'machines by some accident of a science beyond our aboriginal conception of '\n"," 'technology. And then the machines, servants of the people, became the '\n"," 'people’s masters, and great were the battles that followed. The '\n"," 'electron-beings had the power to warp the delicate balances of '\n"," 'atom-structure, and their life-medium was metal, which they permeated and '\n"," 'used to their own ends. Each weapon the people developed was possessed and '\n"," 'turned against them, until a time when the remnants of that vast '\n"," 'civilization found a defense— An insulator. The terminal product or '\n"," 'by-product of all energy research—neutronium. In its shelter they developed '\n"," 'a weapon. What it was we shall never know, and our race will live—or we '\n"," 'shall know, and our race will perish as theirs perished. Sent to destroy the '\n"," 'enemy, it got out of hand and its measureless power destroyed them with it, '\n"," 'and their cities, and their possessed machines. The very earth dissolved in '\n"," 'flame, the crust writhed and shook and the oceans boiled. Nothing escaped '\n"," 'it, nothing that we know as life, and nothing of the pseudolife that had '\n"," 'evolved within the mysterious force-fields of their incomprehensible '\n"," 'machines, save one hardy mutant. Mutant it was, and ironically this one '\n"," 'alone could have been killed by the first simple measures used against its '\n"," 'kind—but it was past time for simple expediences. It was an organized '\n"," 'electron-field possessing intelligence and mobility and a will 5 6 Theodore '\n"," 'Sturgeon to destroy, and little else. Stunned by the holocaust, it drifted '\n"," 'over the grumbling globe, and in a lull in the violence of the forces gone '\n"," 'wild on Earth, sank to the steaming ground in its half-conscious exhaustion. '\n"," 'There it found shelter—shelter built by and for its dead enemies. An '\n"," 'envelope of neutronium. It drifted in, and its consciousness at last fell to '\n"," 'its lowest ebb. And there it lay while the neutronium, with its strange '\n"," 'constant flux, its interminable striving for perfect balance, extended '\n"," 'itself and closed the opening. And thereafter in the turbulent eons that '\n"," 'followed, the envelope tossed like a gray bubble on the surface of the '\n"," 'roiling sphere, for no substance on Earth would have it or combine with it. '\n"," 'The ages came and went, and chemical action and reaction did their '\n"," 'mysterious work, and once again there was life and evolution. And a tribe '\n"," 'found the mass of neutronium, which is not a substance but a static force, '\n"," 'and were awed by its aura of indescribable chill, and they worshiped it and '\n"," 'built a temple around it and made sacrifices to it. And ice and fire and the '\n"," 'seas came and went, and the land rose and fell as the years went by, until '\n"," 'the ruined temple was on a knoll, and the knoll was an island. Islanders '\n"," 'came and went, lived and built and died, and races forgot. So now, somewhere '\n"," 'in the Pacific to the west of the archipelago called Islas Revillagigeda, '\n"," 'there was an uninhabited island. And one day— CHUB HORTON and Tom Jaeger '\n"," 'stood watching the Sprite and her squat tow of three cargo lighters dwindle '\n"," 'over the glassy sea. The big ocean-going towboat and her charges seemed to '\n"," 'be moving out of focus rather than traveling away. Chub spat cleanly around '\n"," 'the cigar that grew out of the comer of his mouth. “That’s that for three '\n"," 'weeks. How’s it feel to be a guinea pig?” “We’ll get it done.” Tom had '\n"," 'little crinkles all around the outer ends of his eyes. He was a head taller '\n"," 'than Chub and rangy, and not so tough, and he was a real operator. Choosing '\n"," 'him as a foreman for the experiment had been wise, for he was competent and '\n"," 'he commanded respect. The theory of airfield construction that they were '\n"," 'testing appealed vastly to him, for here were no oflBcers-in-charge, no '\n"," 'government inspectors, no time-keeping or reports. The government had '\n"," 'allowed the company a temporary land grant, and the idea was Killdozer 7 to '\n"," 'put production-line techniques into the layout and grading of the project. '\n"," 'There were six operators and two mechanics j and more than a million '\n"," 'dollars’ worth of the best equipment I that money could buy. Government '\n"," 'acceptance was to be on a partially completed basis, and contingent on '\n"," 'government standards. The theory obviated both gold-bricking and graft, and '\n"," 'neatly sidestepped the man-power problem. “When that black-topping crew gets '\n"," 'here, I reckon we’ll be ready for ’em,” said Tom. He turned and scanned the '\n"," 'island with an operator’s vision and saw it as it was, and in all the stages '\n"," 'it would pass through, and as it would look when they had finished, with '\n"," 'five thousand feet of clean-draining runway, hard-packed shoulders, four '\n"," 'acres of plane-park, the access road and the short taxiway. He saw the lay '\n"," 'of each lift that the power shovel would cut as it brought down the marl '\n"," 'bluff, and the ruins on top of it that would give them stone to haul down '\n"," 'the salt-flat to the little swamp at the other end, there to be walked in by '\n"," 'the dozers. “We got time to run the shovel up there to the bluff before '\n"," 'dark.” They walked down the beach toward the outcropping where the equipment '\n"," 'stood surrounded by crates and drums of supplies. The three tractors were '\n"," 'ticking over quietly, the two-cycle Diesel chuckling through their mufflers '\n"," 'and the big D-7 whacking away its metronomic compression knock on every easy '\n"," 'revolution. The Dumptors were lined up and silent, for they would not be '\n"," 'ready to work until the shovel was ready to load them. They looked like a '\n"," 'mechanical interpretation of Dr. Dolittle’s “Pushme-pullyou,” the fantastic '\n"," 'animal with two front ends. They had two large driving wheels and two small '\n"," 'steerable wheels. The motor and the driver’s seat were side by side over the '\n"," 'front—or smaller—wheels; but the driver faced the dump body between the big '\n"," 'rear wheels, exactly the opposite qf the way he would sit in a dump truck. '\n"," 'Hence, in traveling from shovel to dumping-ground, the operator drove '\n"," 'backwards, looking over his shoulder, and in dumping he backed the machine '\n"," 'up but he himself traveled forward—quite a trick for fourteen hours a day! '\n"," 'The shovel squatted in the midst of all the others, its great hulk looming '\n"," 'over them, humped there with its boom low and its iron chin on the ground, '\n"," 'like some great tired dinosaur. Rivera, the Puerto Rican mechanic, looked up '\n"," 'grinning as 8 Theodore Sturgeon Tom and Chub approached, and stuck a bleeder '\n"," 'wrench into the top pocket of his coveralls. “She says ‘Sigalo,’ ” he said, '\n"," 'his white teeth flashlighting out of the smear of grease across his mouth. '\n"," '“She says she wan’ to get dirt on dis paint.” He kicked the blade of the '\n"," 'Seven with his heel. Tom sent the grin back—always a surprising thing in his '\n"," 'grave face. “That Seven’ll do that, and she’ll take a good deal off her '\n"," 'bitin’ edge along with the paint before we’re through. Get in the saddle, '\n"," 'Goony. Build a ramp off the rocks down to the flat there, and blade us off '\n"," 'some humps from here to the bluff . yonder. We’re walking the dipper up '\n"," 'there.” The Puerto Rican was in the seat before Tom had finished, and with a '\n"," 'roar the Seven spun in its length and moved back along the outcropping to '\n"," 'the inland edge. Rivera dropped his blade and the sandy marl curled and '\n"," 'piled up in front of the dozer, loading the blade and running off in two '\n"," 'even rolls at the ends. He shoved the load toward the rocky edge, the Seven '\n"," 'revving down as it took the load, blat blat blatting and pulling like a '\n"," 'supercharged ox as it fired slowly enough for them to count the revolutions. '\n"," '“She’s a hunk of machine,” said Tom. “A hunk of operator, too,” gruffed '\n"," 'Chub, and added, “for a mechanic.” “The boy’s all right,” said Kelly. He was '\n"," 'standing there with them, watching the Puerto Rican operate the dozer, as if '\n"," 'he had been there all along, which was the way Kelly always arrived places. '\n"," 'He was tall, slim, with green eyes too long and an easy stretch to the way '\n"," 'he moved, like an attenuated cat. He said, “Never thought I’d see the day '\n"," 'when equipment was shipped set up ready to run like this. Guess no one ever '\n"," 'thought of it before.” “There’s times when heavy equipment has to be '\n"," 'unloaded in a hurry these days,” Tom said. “If they can do it with tanks, '\n"," 'they can do it with construction equipment. We’re doin’ it to build '\n"," 'something instead, is all. Kelly, crank up the shovel. It’s oiled. We’re '\n"," 'walking it over to the bluff.” Kelly swung up into the cab of the big '\n"," 'dipper-stick and, diddling the governor control, pulled up the starting '\n"," 'handle. The Murphy Diesel snorted and settled down into a thudding Killdozer '\n"," '9 idle. Kelly got into the saddle, set up the throttle a little, and began '\n"," 'to boom up. “I still can’t get over it,” said Chub. “Not more’n a year ago '\n"," 'we’d a had two hundred men on a job like this.” Tom smiled. “Yeah, and the '\n"," 'first thing we’d have done would be to build an office building, and then '\n"," 'quarters. Me, I’ll take this way. No timekeepers, no equipment-use reports, '\n"," 'no progress and yardage summaries, no nothin’ but eight men, a million bucks '\n"," 'worth of equipment, an’ three weeks. A shovel an’ a mess of tool crates’ll '\n"," 'keep the rain off us, an’ army field rations’ll keep our bellies full. We’ll '\n"," 'get it done, we’ll get out and we’ll get paid.” Rivera finished the ramp, '\n"," 'turned the Seven around and climbed it, walking the new fill down. At the '\n"," 'top he dropped his blade, floated it, and backed down the ramp, smoothing '\n"," 'out the rolls. At a wave from Tom he started out across the shore, angling '\n"," 'up toward the bluff, beating out the humps and carrying fill into the '\n"," 'hollows. As he worked, he sang, feeling the beat of the mighty motor, the '\n"," 'micrometric obedience of that vast implacable machine. “Why doesn’t that '\n"," 'monkey stick to his grease guns?” Tom turned and took the chewed end of a '\n"," 'match stick out of his mouth. He said nothing, because he had for some time '\n"," 'been trying to make a habit of saying nothing to Joe Dennis. Dennis was an '\n"," 'ex-accountant, drafted out of an office at the last gasp of a defunct '\n"," 'project in the West Indies. He had become an operator because they needed '\n"," 'operators badly. He had been released with alacrity from the office because '\n"," 'of his propensity for small office politics. It was a game he still played, '\n"," 'and completely aside from his boiled-looking red face and his slightly '\n"," 'womanish walk, he was out of place in the field; for boot-licking and '\n"," 'back-stabbing accomplish even less out on the field than they do in an '\n"," 'office. Tom, trying so hard to keep his mind on his work, had to admit to '\n"," 'himself that of all Dennis’ annoying traits the worst was that he was as '\n"," 'good a pan operator as could be found anywhere, and no one could deny it. '\n"," 'Dennis certainly didn’t. “I’ve seen the day when anyone catching one of '\n"," 'those goonies so much as sitting on a machine during lunch, would kick his '\n"," 'fanny,” Dennis groused. “Now they give ’em a man’s work and a man’s pay.” 10 '\n"," 'Theodore Sturgeon “Doin a man’s work, ain’t he?” Tom said. “He’s a damn '\n"," 'Puerto Rican!” ^ Tom turned and looked at him levelly. “Where was it you '\n"," 'said you come from,” he mused. “Oh yeah. Georgia.” “What do you mean by '\n"," 'that?” Tom was already striding away. “Tell you as soon as I have to,” he '\n"," 'flung back over his shoulder. Dennis went back to watching the Seven. Tom '\n"," 'glanced at the ramp and then waved Kelly on. Kelly set his housebrake so the '\n"," 'shovel could not swing, put her into travel gear, and shoved the swing lever '\n"," 'forward. With a crackling of drive chains and a massive scrunching of '\n"," 'compacting coral sand, the shovel’s great flat pads carried her over and '\n"," 'down the ramp. As she tipped over the peak of the ramp the heavy manganese '\n"," 'steel bucket-door gaped open and closed, like a hungry mouth, slamming up '\n"," 'against the bucket until suddenly it latched shut and was quiet./The big '\n"," 'Murphy Diesel crooned hollowly under compression as the machine ran '\n"," 'downgrade and then the sensitive governor took hold and it took up its '\n"," 'belly-beating thud. Peebles was standing by one of the dozer-pan combines, '\n"," 'sucking on his pipe and looking out to sea. He was grizzled and heavy, and '\n"," 'from under the bushiest gray brows looked the calmest gray eyes Tom had ever '\n"," 'seen. Peebles had never gotten angry at a machine—a rare trait in a born '\n"," 'mechanic— and in fifty-odd years he had learned it was even less use getting '\n"," 'angry at a man. Because no matter what, you could always fix what was wrong '\n"," 'with a machine. He said around his pipestem: “Hope you’ll give me back my '\n"," 'boy, there.” Tom’s lips quirked in a little grin. There had been an '\n"," 'understanding between old Peebles and himself ever since they had met. It '\n"," 'was one of those things which exists unspoken—they knew little about each '\n"," 'other because they had never found it necessary to make small talk to keep '\n"," 'their friendship extant. It was enough to know that each could expect the '\n"," 'best from the other, without persuasion. “Rivera?” Tom asked. “I’ll chase '\n"," 'him back as soon as he finishes that service road for the dipper-stick. '\n"," 'Why—got anything on?” “Not much. Want to get that arc welder drained and '\n"," 'flushed and set up a grounded table in case you guys tear anything Killdozer '\n"," '11 up.” He paused. “Besides, the kid’s filling his head up with too many '\n"," 'things at once. Mechanicing is one thing; operating is something else.” '\n"," '“Hasn’t got in his way much so far, has it?”— “Nope. Don’t aim t’ let it, '\n"," 'either. ’Less you need him.” Tom swung up on the pan tractor. “I don’t need '\n"," 'him that bad, Peeby. If you want some help in the meantime, get Dennis.” '\n"," 'Peebles said nothing. He spat. He didn’t say anything at all. “What’s the '\n"," 'matter with Dennis?” Tom wanted to know. “Look yonder,” said Peebles, waving '\n"," 'his pipestem. Out on the beach Dennis was talking to Chub, in Dennis’ '\n"," 'indefatigable style, standing beside Chub, one hand on Chub’s shoulder, As '\n"," 'they watched they saw Dennis call his side-kick, A1 Knowles. “Dennis talks '\n"," 'too much,” said Peebles. “That most generally don’t amount to much, but that '\n"," 'Dennis, he sometimes says too much. Ain’t got what it takes to run a show, '\n"," 'and knows it. Makes up for it by messin’ in between folks.” “He’s harmless,” '\n"," 'said Tom. Still looking up the beach, Peebles said slowly: “Is, so far.” Tom '\n"," 'started to say something, then shrugged. “I’ll send you Rivera,” he said, '\n"," 'and opened the throttle. Like a huge electric dynamo, the two-cycle motor '\n"," 'whined to a crescendo. Tom lifted the dozer with a small lever by his right '\n"," 'thigh and raised the pan with the long control sprouting out from behind his '\n"," 'shoulder. He moved off, setting the rear gate of the scraper so that '\n"," 'anything the blade bit would run off to the side instead of loading into the '\n"," 'pan. He slapped the tractor into sixth gear and whined up to and around the '\n"," 'crawling shovel, cutting neatly in under the boom and running on ahead with '\n"," 'his scraper blade just touching the ground, dragging to a fine grade the '\n"," 'service road Rivera had cut Dennis was saying, “It’s that little Hitler '\n"," 'stuff. Why should I take that kind of talk? ‘You come from Georgia,’ he '\n"," 'says. What is he—a Yankee or something?” “A crackah f’m Macon,” chortled A1 '\n"," 'Knowles, who came from Georgia, too. He was tall and stringy and '\n"," 'round-shouldered. All of his skill was in his hands and feet, brains being a '\n"," 'commodity he had lived without all his life until he 12 Theodore Sturgeon '\n"," 'had met Dennis and used him as. a reasonable facsimile thereof. “Tom didn’t '\n"," 'mean nothing by it,” said Chub. “No, he didn’t mean nothin’. Only that we do '\n"," 'what he says the way he says it, specially if he finds a way we don’t like '\n"," 'it. You wouldn’t do like that, Chub. Al, think Chub would carry on '\n"," 'thataway?” “Sure wouldn’t,” said Al, feeling it expected of him. “Nuts,” '\n"," 'said Chub, pleased and uncomfortable, and thinking, what have I got against '\n"," 'Tom?—not knowing, not liking Tom as well as he had. “Tom’s the man here, '\n"," 'Dennis. We got a job to do—let’s skit and git. Man can take anything for a '\n"," 'lousy six weeks.” “Oh, sho’,” said Al. “Man can take just so much,” Dennis '\n"," 'said. “What they put a man like that on top for, Chub? What’s the matter '\n"," 'with you? Don’t you know grading and drainage as good as Tom? Can Tom stake '\n"," 'out a side hill like you can?” “Sure, sure, but what’s the difference, long '\n"," 'as we get a field built? An’ anyhow, hell with bein’ the boss-man. Who gets '\n"," 'the blame if things don’t run right, anyway?” Dennis stepped back, taking '\n"," 'his hand off Chub’s shoulder, and stuck an elbow in Al’s ribs. “You see '\n"," 'that, Al? Now there’s a smart man. That’s the thing Uncle Tom didn’t bargain '\n"," 'for. Chub, you can count on Al and me to do just that little thing.” “Do '\n"," 'just what little thing?” asked Chub, genuinely puzzled. “Like you said. If '\n"," 'the job goes wrong, the boss gets blamed. So if the boss don’t behave, the '\n"," 'job goes wrong.” “Uh-huh,” agreed Al with the conviction of mental '\n"," 'simplicity. Chub double-took this extraordinary logical process and grasped '\n"," 'wildly at anger as the conversation slid out from under him. “I didn’t say '\n"," 'any such thing! This job is goin’ to get done, no matter what! There’ll be '\n"," 'no damn goldbrick badge on me or anybody else around here if I can help it.” '\n"," '“Tha’s the ol’ fight,” feinted Dennis. “We’ll show that guy what we think of '\n"," 'his kind of slowdown.” “You talk too much,” said Chub and escaped with the '\n"," 'remnants of coherence. Every time he talked with Dennis he walked away '\n"," 'feeling as if he had an unwanted membership card stuck in his pocket that he '\n"," 'couldn’t throw away with a clear conscience. Killdozer 13 Rivera ran his '\n"," 'road up under the bluff, swung the Seven around, punched out the master '\n"," 'clutch and throttled down, idling. Tom was making his pass with the pan, and '\n"," 'as he approached, Rivera slipped out of the seat and behind the tractor, '\n"," 'laying a sensitive hand on the final drive casing and sprocket bushings, '\n"," 'checking for overheating. Tom pulled alongside and beckoned him up on the '\n"," 'pan tractor. “Que pase, Goony? Anything wrong?” Rivera shook his head and '\n"," 'grinned. “Nothing wrong. She is perfect, that ‘De Siete.’ She—” “That what? '\n"," '‘Daisy Etta’?” “De siete. In Spanish, D-7. It means something in English?” '\n"," '“Got you wrong,” smiled Tom. “But Daisy Etta is a girl’s name in English, '\n"," 'all the same.” He shifted the pan tractor into neutral and engaged the '\n"," 'clutch, and jumped off the machine. Rivera followed. They climbed aboard the '\n"," 'Seven, Tom at the controls. Rivera said “Daisy Etta,” and grinned so widely '\n"," 'that a soft little clucking noise came from behind his back teeth. He '\n"," 'reached out his hand, crooked his little finger around one of the tall '\n"," 'steering clutch levers, and pulled it all the way back. Tom laughed '\n"," 'outright. “You got something there,” he said. “The easiest runnin’ cat ever '\n"," 'built. Hydraulic steerin’ clutches and brakes that’ll bring you to a dead '\n"," 'stop if you spit on ’em. Forward an’ reverse lever so’s you got all your '\n"," 'speeds front and backwards. A little different from the old jobs. They had '\n"," 'no booster springs, eight-ten years ago; took a sixty-pound pull to get a '\n"," 'steerin’ clutch back. Cuttin’ a side-hill with an angle-dozer really was a '\n"," 'job in them days. You try it sometime, dozin’ with one hand, holdin’ her '\n"," 'nose out o’ the bank with the other, ten hours a day. And what’d it get you? '\n"," 'Eighty cents an hour an’ ”—Tom took his cigarette and butted the fiery end '\n"," 'out against the homy palm of his hand—“these.” “Santa Maria!” “Want to talk '\n"," 'to you, Goony. Want to look over the bluff, too, at that stone up there. '\n"," 'It’ll take Kelly pret’ near an hour to get this far and sumped in, anyhow.” '\n"," 'They growled up the slope, Tom feeling the ground under the four-foot brush, '\n"," 'taking her up in a zigzag course like a hairpin road on a mountainside. '\n"," 'Though the Seven carried a muffler on the exhaust stack that stuck up out of '\n"," 'the hood 14 Theodore Sturgeon before them, the blat of four big cylinders '\n"," 'hauling fourteen tons of steel upgrade could outshout any man’s '\n"," 'conversation, so they sat without talking, Tom driving, Rivera watching his '\n"," 'hands flick over the controls. The bluff started in a low ridge running '\n"," 'almost the length of the little island, like a lopsided backbone. Toward the '\n"," 'center it rose abruptly, sent a wing out toward the rocky outcropping at the '\n"," 'beach where their equipment had been unloaded, and then rose again to a '\n"," 'small, almost square plateau area, half a mile across. It was humpy and '\n"," 'rough until they could see all of it, when they realized how incredibly '\n"," 'level it was, under the brush and ruins that covered it. In the center— and '\n"," 'exactly in the center they realized suddenly—was a low, overgrown mOund. Tom '\n"," 'threw out the clutch and revved her down. “Survey report said there was '\n"," 'stone up here,” Tom said, vaulting out of the seat. “Let’s walk around '\n"," 'some.” They walked toward the knoll, Tom’s eyes casting about as he went. He '\n"," 'stooped down into the heavy, short grass and scooped up a piece of stone, '\n"," 'blue-gray, hard and brittle. /‘Rivera—look at this. This is what the report '\n"," 'was talking about. See—more of it. All in small pieces, though. We need big '\n"," 'stuff for the bog if we can get it.” “Good stone?” asked Rivera. • “Yes, '\n"," 'boy—but it don’t belong here. Th’ whole island’s sand and marl and sandstone '\n"," 'on the outcrop down yonder. This here’s a bluestone, like diamond clay. '\n"," 'Harder’n blazes. I never saw this stuff on a marl hill before. Or near one. '\n"," 'Anyhow, root around and see if there is any big stuff.” They walked on. '\n"," 'Rivera suddenly dipped down and pulled grass aside. “Tom—here’s a beeg one.” '\n"," 'Tom came over and looked down at the corner of stone sticking up out of the '\n"," 'topsoil. “Yeh. Goony, get your girlfriend over here and we’ll root it out.” '\n"," 'Rivera sprinted back to the idling dozer and climbed aboard. He brought the '\n"," 'machine over to where Tom waited, stopped, stood up and peered over the '\n"," 'front of the machine to locate the stone, then sat down and shifted gears. '\n"," 'Before he could move the machine Tom was on the fender beside him, checking '\n"," 'him with a hand on his arm. “No, boy—no. Not third. First. And half '\n"," 'throttle. That’s it. Killdozer 15 Don’t try to bash a rock out of the '\n"," 'ground. Go on up to it easy; set your blade against it, lift it out, don’t '\n"," 'boot it out. Take it with the middle of your blade, not the corner—get the '\n"," 'load on both hydraulic cylinders. Who told you to do like that?” “No one '\n"," 'tol’ me“~Tom. I see a man do it, I do it.” “Yeah? Who was it?” “Dennis, '\n"," 'but—” “Listen, Goony, if you want to learn anything from Dennis, watch him '\n"," 'while he’s on a pan. He dozes like he talks. That reminds me—what I wanted '\n"," 'to talk to you about. You ever have any trouble with him?” Rivera spread his '\n"," 'hands. “How I have trouble when he never talk to me?” ^ “Well, that’s all '\n"," 'right then. You keep it that way. Dennis is O.K., I guess, but you better '\n"," 'keep away from him.” He went on to tell the boy then about what Peebles had '\n"," 'said concerning being an operator and a mechanic at the same time. Rivera’s '\n"," 'lean dark face fell, and his hand strayed to the blade control, touching it '\n"," 'lightly, feeling the composition grip and the machined locknuts that held '\n"," 'it. When Tom had quite finished he said: “O.K., Tom—if you want, you break '\n"," '’em, I feex ’em. But if you wan’ help some time, I run Daisy Etta for you, '\n"," 'no?” “Sure, kid, sure. But don’t forget, no man can do everything.” “You can '\n"," 'do everything,” said the boy. Tom leaped off the machine and Rivera shifted '\n"," 'into first and crept up to the stone, setting the blade gently against it. '\n"," 'Taking the load, the mighty engine audibly bunched its muscles; Rivera '\n"," 'opened the throttle a little and the machine set solidly against the stone, '\n"," 'the tracks slipping, digging into the ground, piling loose earth up behind. '\n"," 'Tom raised a fist, thumb up, and the boy began lifting his blade. The Seven '\n"," 'lowered her snout like an ox pulling through mud; the front of the tracks '\n"," 'buried themselves deeper and the blade slipped upward an inch on the rock, '\n"," 'as if it were on a ratchet. The stone shifted, and suddenly heaved itself up '\n"," 'out of the earth that covered it, bulging the sod aside like a ship’s slow '\n"," 'bow-wave. And the blade lost its grip and slipped over the stone. Rivera '\n"," 'slapped out the master clutch within an ace of letting the mass of 16 '\n"," 'Theodore Sturgeon it poke through his radiator core. Reversing, he set the '\n"," 'blade against it again and rolled it at last into daylight. Tom stood '\n"," 'staring at it, scratching the back of his neck. Rivera got off the machine '\n"," 'and stood beside him. For a long time they said nothing. The stone was '\n"," 'roughly rectangular, shaped like a brick with one end cut at about a '\n"," 'thirty-degree angle. And on the angled face was a square-cut ridge, like the '\n"," 'tongue on a piece of milled lumber. The stone was about 3x2x2 feet, and must '\n"," 'have weighed six or seven hundred pounds. “Now that,” said Tom, bug-eyed, '\n"," '“didn’t grow here, and if it did it never grew that way.” “Una piedra de una '\n"," 'casa,” said Rivera softly. “Tom, there was a building here, no?” Tom turned '\n"," 'suddenly to look at the knoll. “There is a building here—or what’s left of '\n"," 'it. Lord on’y knows how old—” They stood there in the slowly dwindling '\n"," 'light, staring at the knoll; and there came upon them a feeling of '\n"," 'oppression, as if there were no wind and no sound anywhere. And yet there '\n"," 'was wind, and behind them Daisy Etta whacked away with her muttering idle, '\n"," 'and nothing had changed and—was that it? That nothing had changed? That '\n"," 'nothing would change, or could, here? Tom opened his mouth twice to speak, '\n"," 'and couldn’t, or didn’t want to—he didn’t know which. Rivera slumped down '\n"," 'suddenly on his hunkers, back erect, and his eyes wide. It grew very cold. '\n"," '“It’s cold,” Tom said, and his voice sounded harsh to him. And the wind blew '\n"," 'warm on them, the earth was warm under Rivera’s knees. The cold was not a '\n"," 'lack of heat, but a lack of something else—warmth, but the specific warmth '\n"," 'of life-force, perhaps. The feeling of oppression grew, as if their '\n"," 'recognition of the strangeness of the place had started it, and their '\n"," 'increasing sensitivity to it made it grow. Rivera said something, quietly, '\n"," 'in Spanish. “What are you looking at?” asked Tom. Rivera started violently, '\n"," 'threw up an arm, as if to ward off the crash of Tom’s voice. “I . . . there '\n"," 'is nothin’ to see, Tom. I feel this way wance befqre. I dunno—” He shook his '\n"," 'head, his eyes wide and / Killdozer 17 blank. “An’ after, there was being '\n"," 'wan hell of a thunderstorm—” His voice petered out. Tom took his shoulder '\n"," 'and hauled him roughly to his feet. “Goony! You slap-happy?” The boy smiled, '\n"," 'almost gently. The down on his upper lip held little spheres of sweat. “I '\n"," 'ain’ nothin’, Tom. I’m jus’ scare like hell.” “You scare yourself right back '\n"," 'up there on that cat and git to work,” Tom roared. More quietly then, he '\n"," 'said, “I know there’s something—wrong—here, Goony, but that ain’t goin’ to '\n"," 'get us a runway built. Anyhow, I know what to do about a dawg ’at gits '\n"," 'gunshy. Ought to be able to do as much fer you. Git along to th’ mound now '\n"," 'and see if it ain’t a cache o’ big stone for us. We got a swamp down there '\n"," 'to fill.” Rivera hesitated, started to speak, swallowed and then walked '\n"," 'slowly over to the Seven. Tom stood watching him, closing ljis mind to the '\n"," 'impalpable pressure of something, somewhere near, making his guts cold. The '\n"," 'bulldozer nosed over to the mound, grunting, reminding Tom suddenly that the '\n"," 'machine’s Spanish slang name was puerco—pig, boar. Rivera angled into the '\n"," 'edge of the mound with the cutting corner of the blade. Dirt and brush '\n"," 'curled up, fell away from the mound and loaded from the bank side, out along '\n"," 'the moldboard. The boy finished his pass along the mound, carried the load '\n"," 'past it and wasted it out on the flat, turned around and started back again. '\n"," 'Ten minutes later Rivera struck stone, the manganese steel screaming along '\n"," 'it, a puff of gray dust spouting from the cutting corner. Tom knelt and '\n"," 'examined it after the machine had passed. It was the same kind of stone they '\n"," 'had found out on the flat—and shaped the same way. But here it was a wall, '\n"," 'the angled faces of the block ends obviously tongued and grooved together. ^ '\n"," 'Cold, cold as— Tom took one deep breath and wiped sweat out of his eyes. “I '\n"," 'don’t care,” he whispered, “I got to have that stone. I got to fill me a '\n"," 'swamp.” He stood back and motioned to Rivera to blade into a chipped crevice '\n"," 'in the buried wall. The Seven swung into the wall and stopped while Rivera '\n"," 'shifted into first, throttled down and lowered his jplade. Tom looked up '\n"," 'into his face. The boy’s lips were white. He eased 18 Theodore Sturgeon in '\n"," 'the master clutch, the blade dipped and the corner swung neatly into the '\n"," 'crevice. The dozer blatted protestingly and began to crab sideways, pivoting '\n"," 'on the end of the blade. Tom jumped out of the way, ran around behind the '\n"," 'machine, which was almost parallel with the wall now, and stood in the '\n"," 'clear, one hand raised ready to signal, his eyes on the straining blade. And '\n"," 'then everything happened at once. With a toothy snap the block started and '\n"," 'came free, pivoting outward from its square end, bringing with it its '\n"," 'neighbor. The block above them dropped, and the whole mound seemed to '\n"," 'settle. And something whooshed out of the black hole where the rocks had '\n"," 'been. Something like a fog, but not a fog that could be seen, something huge '\n"," 'that could not be measured. With it came a gust of that cold which was not '\n"," 'cold, and the smell of ozone, and the prickling crackle of a mighty static '\n"," 'discharge. Tom was fifty feet from the wall before he knew he had moved. He '\n"," 'stopped and saw the Seven suddenly buck like a wild stallion, once, and '\n"," 'Rivera turning over twice in the air. Tom shouted some meaningless syllable '\n"," 'and tore over to the boy, where he sprawled in the rough grass, lifted him '\n"," 'in his arms, and ran. Only then did he realize that he was running from the '\n"," 'machine. It was like a mad thing. Its moldboard rose and fell. It curved '\n"," 'away from the mound, howling governor gone wild, controls flailing. The '\n"," 'blade dug repeatedly into the earth, gouging it up in great dips through '\n"," 'which the tractor plunged, clanking and bellowing furiously. It raced away '\n"," 'in a great irregular arc, turned and came snorting back to , the mound, '\n"," 'where it beat at the buried wall, slewed and scraped and roared. Tom reached '\n"," 'the edge of the plateau sobbing for breath, and kneeling, laid the boy '\n"," 'gently down on the grass. “Goony, boy . . . hey—” The long silken eyelashes '\n"," 'fluttered, lifted. Something wrenched in Tom as he saw the eyes, rolled '\n"," 'right back so that only the whites showed. Rivera drew a long quivering '\n"," 'breath which caught suddenly. He coughed twice, threw his head from side to '\n"," 'side so violently that Tom took it between his hands and steadied it. '\n"," 'Killdozer 19 “Ay . . . Maria madre . . .que me pasado, Tom—w’at has happen '\n"," 'to me?” “Fell off the Seven, stupid. You . . . how you feel?” Rivera '\n"," 'scrabbled at the ground, got his elbows half under him, then sank back '\n"," 'weakly. “Feel O.K. Headache like hell. W-w’at happen to my feets?” “Feet? '\n"," 'They hurt?” “No hurt—” The young face went gray, the lips tightened with '\n"," 'effort. “No nothin’, Tom.” “You can’t move ’em?” Rivera shook his head, '\n"," 'still trying. Tom stood up. “You take it easy. I’ll go get Kelly. Be fight '\n"," 'back.” He walked away quickly and when Rivera called to him he did not turn '\n"," 'around. Tom had seen a man with a broken back before. At the edge of the '\n"," 'little plateau Tom stopped, listening. In the deepening twilight he could '\n"," 'see the bulldozer standing by the mound. The motor was running; she had not '\n"," 'stalled herself. But what stopped Tom was that she wasn’t idling, but '\n"," 'revving up and down as if an impatient hand were on the throttle—hroom '\n"," 'hroooom, running up and up far faster than even a broken governor should '\n"," 'permit, then coasting down to near silence, broken by the explosive '\n"," 'punctuation of sharp and irregular firing. Then it would run up and up '\n"," 'again, almost screaming, sustaining a r.p.m. that threatened every moving '\n"," 'part, shaking the great machine like some deadly ague. Tom walked swiftly '\n"," 'toward the Seven, a puzzled and grim frown on his weather-beaten face. '\n"," 'Governors break down occasionally, and once in a while you will have a motor '\n"," 'tear itself to pieces, revving up out of control. But it will either do that '\n"," 'or it will rev down and quit. If an operator is fool enough to leave his '\n"," 'machine with the master clutch engaged, the machine will take off and run '\n"," 'the way the Seven had—but it will not turn unless the blade corner catches '\n"," 'in something unresisting, and then the chances are very strong that it will '\n"," 'stall. But in any case, it was past reason for any machine to act this way, '\n"," 'revving up and down, running, turning, lifting and dropping the blade.   The '\n"," 'motor slowed as he approached, and at last settled down into something like '\n"," 'a steady and regular idle. Tom had the sudden crazy impression that it was '\n"," 'watching him. He 20 Theodore Sturgeon shrugged off the feeling, walked up '\n"," 'and laid a hand on the fender. The Seven reacted like a wild stallion. The '\n"," 'big Diesel roared, and Tom distinctly saw the master clutch lever snap back '\n"," 'over center. He leaped clear, expecting the machine to jolt forward, but '\n"," 'apparently it was in a reverse gear, for it shot backwards, one track '\n"," 'locked, and the near end of the blade swung in a swift vicious arc, breezing '\n"," 'a bare fraction of an inch past his hip as he danced back out of the way. '\n"," 'And as if it had bounced off a wall, the tractor had shifted and was bearing '\n"," 'down on him, the twelve-foot blade rising, the two big headlights looihing '\n"," 'over him on their bow-legged supports, looking like the protruding eyes of '\n"," 'some mighty toad. Tom had no choice but to leap straight up and grasp the '\n"," 'top of the blade in his two hands, leaning back hard to brace his feet '\n"," 'against the curved moldboard. The blade dropped and sank into the soft '\n"," 'topsoil, digging a deep little swale in the ground. The earth loading on the '\n"," 'moldboard rose and churned around Tom’s legs; he stepped wildly, keeping '\n"," 'them clear of the rolling drag of it. Up came the blade then, leaving a '\n"," 'four-foot pile at the edge of the pit; down and up the tractor raced as the '\n"," 'tracks went into it; up and up as they climbed the pile of dirt. A quick '\n"," 'balance and overbalance as the machine lurched up and over like a motorcycle '\n"," 'taking a jump off a ramp, and then a spine-shaking crash as fourteen tons of '\n"," 'metal smashed blade-first into the ground. Part of the leather from Tom’s '\n"," 'tough palms stayed with the blade as he was flung off. He went head over '\n"," 'heels backwards, but had his feet gathered and sprang as they touched the '\n"," 'ground; for he knew that no machine could bury its blade like that and get '\n"," 'out easily. He leaped to the top of the blade, got one hand on the radiator '\n"," 'cap, vaulted. Perversely, the cap broke from its hinge and came away in his '\n"," 'hand, in that split instant when only that hand rested on anything. Off '\n"," 'balance, he landed on his shoulder with his legs flailing the air, his body '\n"," 'sliding off the hood’s smooth shoulder toward the track now churning the '\n"," 'earth beneath. He made a wild grab at the air intake pipe, barely had it in '\n"," 'his fingers when the dozer freed itself and shot backwards up and over the '\n"," 'hump. Again that breathless flight pivoting over the top, and the clanking '\n"," 'crash as the machine landed, this time almost flat on its tracks.  x '\n"," 'Killdozer 21 The jolt tore Tom’s hand away, and as he slid back over the '\n"," 'hood the crook of his elbow caught the exhaust stack, the dull red metal '\n"," 'biting into his flesh. He grunted and clamped the arm around it. His '\n"," 'momentum carried him around it, and his feet crashed into the steering '\n"," 'clutch levers. Hooking one with his instep, he doubled his legs and whipped '\n"," 'himself back, scrabbling at the smooth warm metal, crawling frantically '\n"," 'backward until he finally fell heavily into the seat. “Now,” he gritted '\n"," 'through a red wall of pain, “you’re gonna git operated.” And he kicked out '\n"," 'the master clutch. The motor wailed, with the load taken off so suddenly. '\n"," 'Tom grasped the throttle, his thumb down on the ratchet release, and he '\n"," 'shoved the lever forward to shut off the fuel. It wouldn’t shut off; it went '\n"," 'down to a slow idle, but it wouldn’t shut off. “There’s one thing you can’t '\n"," 'do without,” he muttered, “compression.” He stood up and leaned around the '\n"," 'dash, reaching for the compression-release lever. As he came up out of the '\n"," 'seat, the engine revved up again. He turned to the throttle, which had '\n"," 'snapped back into the “open” position. As his hand touched it the master '\n"," 'clutch lever snapped in and the howling machine lurched forward with a jerk '\n"," 'that snapped his head on his shoulders and threw him heavily back into the '\n"," 'seat. He snatched at the hydraulic blade control and threw it to “float” '\n"," 'position; and then as the falling moldboard touched the ground, into “power '\n"," 'down.” The cutting edge bit into the ground and the engine began to labor. '\n"," 'Holding the blade control, he pushed the throttle forward with his other '\n"," 'hand. One of the steering clutch levers whipped back and struck him '\n"," 'agonizingly on the kneecap. He involuntarily let go of the blade control and '\n"," 'the moldboard began to rise. The engine began to turn faster and he realized '\n"," 'that it was not responding to the throttle. Cursing, he leaped to his feet; '\n"," 'the suddenly flailing steering clutch levers struck him three times in the '\n"," 'groin before he could get between them. Blind with pain, Tom clung gasping '\n"," 'to the dash. The oil-pressure gauge fell off the dash to his right, with a '\n"," 'tinkling of broken glass, and from its broken quarter-inch line scalding oil '\n"," 'drenched him. The shock of it snapped back his wavering consciousness. '\n"," 'Ignoring the blows of the left steering clutch and the master clutch which '\n"," 'had started the same mad punch- 22 Theodore Sturgeon ing, he bent over the '\n"," 'left end of the dash and grasped the compression lever. The tractor rushed '\n"," 'forward and spun sick-eningly, and Tom knew he was thrown. But as he felt '\n"," 'himself leave the decking his hand punched the compression lever down. The '\n"," 'great valves at the cylinder heads opened and locked open; atomized fuel and '\n"," 'superheated air chattered out, and as Tom’s head and shoulders struck the '\n"," 'ground the great wild machine rolled to a stop, stood silently except for '\n"," 'the grumble of water boiling in the cooling system. Minutes later Tom raised '\n"," 'his head and groaned. He rolled over and sat up, his chin on his knees, '\n"," 'washed by wave after wave of pain. As they gradually subsided, he crawled to '\n"," 'the machine and pulled himself to his feet, hand over hand on the track. And '\n"," 'groggily he began to cripple the tractor, at least for the night. He opened '\n"," 'the cock under the fuel tank, left the warm yellow fluid gushing out on the '\n"," 'ground. He opened the drain on the reservoir by the injection pump. He found '\n"," 'a piece of wire in the crank box and with it tied down the compression '\n"," 'release lever. He crawled up on the machine, wrenched the hood and ball jar '\n"," 'off the air intake precleaner, pulled off his shirt and stuffed it down the '\n"," 'pipe. He pushed the throttle all the way forward and locked it with the '\n"," 'locking pin. And he shut off the fuel on the main line from the tank to the '\n"," 'pump. Then he climbed heavily to the ground and slogged back to the edge of '\n"," 'the plateau where he had left Rivera. They didn’t know Tom was hurt until an '\n"," 'hour and a half later—there had been too much to do—rigging a stretcher for '\n"," 'the Puerto Rican, building him a shelter, an engine crate with an Army pup '\n"," 'tent for a roof. They brought out the first-aid kit and the medical books '\n"," 'and did what they could—tied and splinted and dosed with an opiate. Tom was '\n"," 'a mass of bruises, and his right arm, where it had hooked the exhaust stack, '\n"," 'was a flayed mass. They fixed him up then, old Peebles handling the sulfa '\n"," 'powder and bandages like a trained nurse. And only then was there talk. '\n"," '“I’ve seen a man thrown off a pan,” said Dennis, as’ they sat around the '\n"," 'coffee urn munching C rations. “Sittin’ up on the arm rest on a cat, looking '\n"," 'backwards. Cat hit a rock and bucked. Threw him off on the track. Stretched '\n"," 'him out ten feet long.” He in-whistled some coffee to dilute the mouthful 23 '\n"," 'Killdozer, of food he had been talking around, and masticated noisily. '\n"," '“Man’s a fool to set up there on one side of his butt even on a pan. Can’t '\n"," 'see why th’ goony was doin’ it on a dozer.” “He wasn’t,” said Tom. Kelly '\n"," 'rubbed his pointed jaw. “He set flat on th’ seat an’ was th’owed?” “That’s '\n"," 'right.” After an unbelieving silence Dennis said, “What was he doin’—drivin’ '\n"," 'over sixty?” Tom looked around the circle of faces lit up by the '\n"," 'over-artificial brilliance of a pressure lantern, and wondered what the '\n"," 'reaction would be if he told it all just as it was. He had to say something, '\n"," 'and it didn’t look as if it could be the truth. “He was workin’,” he said '\n"," 'finally. “Bucking stone out of the wall of an old building up on the mesa '\n"," 'there. One turned loose an’ as it did the governor must’ve gone haywire. She '\n"," 'buckled like a loco hoss and run off.” “Run off?” Tom opened his mouth and '\n"," 'closed it again, and just nodded. Dennis said, “Well, reckon that’s what '\n"," 'happens when you put a mechanic to operatin’.” “That had nothin’ to do with '\n"," 'it,” Tom snapped. Peebles spoke up quickly. “Tom—what about the Seven? Broke '\n"," 'up any?” “Some,” said Tom. “Better look at the steering clutches. An’ she '\n"," 'was hot.” “Head’s cracked,” said Harris, a burly young man with shoulders '\n"," 'like a buffalo and a famous thirst. “How do you know?” “Saw it when A1 and '\n"," 'me went up with the stretcher to get the kid while you all were building the '\n"," 'shelter. Hot water runnin’ down the side of the block.” “You mean you walked '\n"," 'all the way out to the mound to look at that tractor while the kid was lyin’ '\n"," 'there? I told you where he was!” “Out to the mound!” A1 Knowles’ pop eyes '\n"," 'teetered out of their sockets. “We found that cat stalled twenty feet away '\n"," 'from where the kid was!” “What!” 24 Theodore Sturgeon “That’s right, Tom,” '\n"," 'said Harris. “What’s eatin’ you? Where’d you leave it?” “I told you ... by '\n"," 'the mound ... the oF building we cut into.” “Leave the startin’ motor '\n"," 'runnin’?” “Starting motor?” Tom’s mind caught the picture of the small, '\n"," 'two-cylinder gasoline engine bolted to the side of the big Diesel’s '\n"," 'crankcase, coupled* through a Bendix gear and clutch to the flywheel of the '\n"," 'Diesel to crank it. He remember his last glance at the still machine, silent '\n"," 'but for the sound of water boiling. “Hell no!” A1 and Harris exchanged a '\n"," 'glance. “I guess you were sort of slap-happy at the time, Tom,” Harris said, '\n"," 'not unkindly. “When we were halfway up the hill we heard it, and you know '\n"," 'you can’t mistake that racket. Sounded like it was under a load.” Tom beat '\n"," 'softly at his temples with his clenched fists. “I left that machine dead,” '\n"," 'he said quietly. “I got compression off her and tied down the lever. I even '\n"," 'stuffed my shirt in the intake. I drained the tank. But—I didn’t touch the '\n"," 'starting motor.” * Peebles wanted to know why he had gone to all that '\n"," 'trouble. Tom just looked vaguely at him and shook his head. “I shoulda '\n"," 'pulled the wires. I never thought about the starting motor,” he whispered. '\n"," 'Then, “Harris—you say you found the starting motor running when you got to '\n"," 'the top?” “No—she was stalled. And hot—awmighty hot. I’d say the startin’ '\n"," 'motor was seized up tight. That must be it, Tom. You left the startin’ motor '\n"," 'runnin’ and somehow engaged the clutch an’ Bendix.” His voice lost '\n"," 'conviction as he said it— it takes seventeen separate motions to start a '\n"," 'tractor of this type. “Anyhow, she was in gear an’ crawled along on the '\n"," 'little motor.” “I done that once,” said Chub. “Broke a con rod on a Eight, '\n"," 'on a highway job. Walked her about three-quarters of a mile on the startin’ '\n"," 'motor that way. Only I had to stop every hundred yards and let her cool down '\n"," 'some.” Not without sarcasm, Dennis said, “Seems to me like the Seven was out '\n"," 'to get th’ goony. Made one pass at him and then went back to finish the '\n"," 'job.” A1 Knowles haw-hawed extravagantly. Killdozer 25 Tom stood up, shaking '\n"," 'his head, and went off among the crates to the hospital they had jury-rigged '\n"," 'for the kid. A dim light was burning inside, and Rivera lay very still, with '\n"," 'his eyes closed. Tom leaned in the doorway—the open end of the engine '\n"," 'crate—and watched him for a moment. Behind him he could hear the murmur of '\n"," 'the crew’s voices; the night was otherwise windless and still. Rivera’s face '\n"," 'was the peculiar color that olive skin takes when drained of blood. Tom '\n"," 'looked at his chest and for a panicky moment thought he could discern no '\n"," 'movement there. He entered and put a hand over the boy’s heart. Rivera '\n"," 'shivered, his eyes flew open, and he drew a sudden breath which caught '\n"," 'raggedly at the back of his throat. “Tom . . . Tom!” he cried weakly. “O. '\n"," 'K., Goony . . . que pase?” “She comeen back . . . Tom!” “Who?” “El de '\n"," 'siete.” Daisy Etta—“She ain’t cornin’ back, kiddo. You’re off the mesa now. '\n"," 'Keep your chin up, fella.” Rivera’s dark, doped eyes stared up at him '\n"," 'without expression. Tom moved back and the eyes continued to stare. They '\n"," 'weren’t seeing anything. “Go to sleep,” he whispered. The eyes closed '\n"," 'instantly. Kelly was saying that nobody ever got hurt on a construction job '\n"," 'unless somebody was dumb. “An’ most times you don’t realize how dumb what '\n"," 'you’re doin’ is until somebody does get hurt.” “The dumb part was gettin* a '\n"," 'kid, an’ not even an operator at that, up on a machine,” said Dennis in his '\n"," 'smuggest voice. “I heard you try to sing that song before,” said old Peebles '\n"," 'quietly. “I hate to have to point out anything like this to a man because it '\n"," 'don’t do any good to make comparisons. But I’ve worked with that fella '\n"," 'Rivera for a long time now, an’ I’ve seen ’em as good but doggone few '\n"," 'better. As far as you’re concerned, you’re O. K. on a pan, but the kid could '\n"," 'give you cards and spades and still make you look like a cost accountant on '\n"," 'a dozer.” Dennis half rose and mouthed something filthy. He looked at A1 '\n"," 'Knowles for backing and got it. He looked around the circle and got none. '\n"," 'Peebles lounged back, sucking on his 26 Theodore Sturgeon pipe, watching '\n"," 'from under those bristling brows. Dennis subsided, running now on another '\n"," 'tack. “So what does that prove? The better you say he is, the less reason he '\n"," 'had to fall off a cat and get himself hurt.” “I haven’t got the thing '\n"," 'straight yet,” said Chub, in a voice whose tone indicated ‘I hate to admit '\n"," 'it, but—’ About this time Tom returned, like a sleepwalker, standing with '\n"," 'the brilliant pressure lantern between him and Dennis. Dennis rambled right '\n"," 'on, not knowing he was anywhere near: “That’s something you never will find '\n"," 'out. That Puerto Rican is a pretty husky kid. Could be Tom said somethin’ he '\n"," 'didn’t like an’ he tried to put a knife in Tom’s back. They all do, y’know. '\n"," 'Tom didn’t get all that bashin’ around just stoppin’ a machine. They must of '\n"," 'went round an’ round for a while an’ the goony wound up with a busted back. '\n"," 'Tom sets the dozer to walk him down while he lies there and comes on down '\n"," 'here and tries to tell us—” His voice fluttered to a stop as Tom loomed over '\n"," 'him. Tom grabbed the pan operator up by the slack of his shirt front with '\n"," 'his uninjured arm and shook him like an empty burlap bag. “Skunk,” he '\n"," 'growled. “I oughta lower th’ boom on you.” He set Dennis on his feet and '\n"," 'backhanded his face with the edge of his forearm. Dennis went down—cowered '\n"," 'down, rather than fell. “Aw, Tom, I was just talkin’. Just a joke, Tom, I '\n"," 'was just—” “Yellow, too,” snarled Tom, stepping forward, raising a solid '\n"," 'Texan boot. Peebles barked “Tom!” and the foot came back to the ground. “Out '\n"," 'o’ my sight,” rumbled the foreman. “Git!” Dennis got. A1 Knowles said '\n"," 'vaguely, “Naow, Tom, y’all cain’t—” “You, y’wall-eyed string-bean!” Tom '\n"," 'raved, his voice harsh and strained. “Go ’long with yer Siamese twin!” “O. '\n"," 'K., O. K.,” said Al, white-faced, and disappeared into the dark after '\n"," 'Dennis. “Nuts to this,” said Chub. “I’m turnin’ in.” He went to a crate and '\n"," 'hauled out a mosquito-hooded sleeping bag and went off without another word. '\n"," 'Harris and Kelly, who were both on their feet, sat down again. Old Peebles '\n"," 'hadn’t moved. Tom stood staring out into the dark, his arms straight at his '\n"," 'sides, his fists knotted. • Killdozer 27 “Sit down,” said Peebles gently. '\n"," 'Tom tinned and stared at him. “Sit down. I can’t change that dressing ’less '\n"," 'you do.” He pointed at the bandage around Tom’s elbow. It was red, a '\n"," 'widening stain, the tattered tissues having parted as the big Georgian '\n"," 'bunched his infuriated muscles. He sat down. “Talkin’ about dumbness,” said '\n"," 'Harris calmly, as Peebles went to work, “I was about to say that I got the '\n"," 'record. I done the dumbest thing anybody ever did on a machine. You can’t '\n"," 'top it.” “I could,” said Kelly. “Runnin’ a crane dragline once. Put her in '\n"," 'boom gear and started to boom her up. Had an eighty-five-foot stick on her. '\n"," 'Machine was standing on wooden mats in th’ middle of a swamp. Heard the '\n"," 'motor miss and got out of the saddle to look at the filter-glass. Messed '\n"," 'around back there longer than I figured, and the boom went straight up in '\n"," 'the air and fell backwards over the cab. Th’ jolt tilted my mats an’ she '\n"," 'slid backwards slow and stately as you please, butt-first into the mud. '\n"," 'Buried up to the eyeballs, she was.” He laughed quietly. “Looked like a '\n"," 'ditching machine!” “I still say I done the dumbest thing ever, bar none,” '\n"," 'said Harris. “It was on a river job, widening a channel. I come back to work '\n"," 'from a three-day binge, still rum-dumb. Got up on a dozer an’ was workin’ '\n"," 'around on the edge of a twenty-foot cliff. Down at the foot of the cliff was '\n"," 'a big hickory tree, an’ growin’ right along the edge was a great big limb. I '\n"," 'got the dopey idea I should break it off. I put one track on the limb and '\n"," 'the other on the cliff edge and run out away from the trunk. I was about '\n"," 'halfway out, an’ the branch saggin’ some, before I thought what would happen '\n"," 'if it broke. Just about then it did break. You know hickory—if it breaks\" at '\n"," 'all it breaks altogether. So down we go into thirty feet of water— me an’ '\n"," 'the cat. I got out from under somehow. When all them bubbles stopped cornin’ '\n"," 'up I swum around lookin’ down at it. I was still paddlin’ around when the '\n"," 'superintendent came rushin’ up. He wants to know what’s up. I yell at him, '\n"," '“Look down there, the way that water is movin’ an’ shiftin’, looks like the '\n"," 'cat is workin’ down there.” He pursed his lips and tsk tsked. “My, that man '\n"," 'said some nasty things to me.” “Where’d you get your next job?” Kelly '\n"," 'exploded. “Oh, he didn’t fire me,” said Harris soberly. “Said he 28 Theodore '\n"," 'Sturgeon couldn’t afford to fire a man as dumb as that. Said^he wanted me '\n"," 'around to look at whenever he felt bad.” Tom said, “Thanks, you guys. That’s '\n"," 'as good a way as any of sayin’ that everybody makes mistakes.” He stood up, '\n"," 'examining the new dressing, turning his arm in front of the lantern. “You '\n"," 'all can think what you please, but I don’t recollect there was any dumbness '\n"," 'went on that mesa this evenin’. That’s finished with, anyway. Do I have to '\n"," 'say that Dennis’ idea about it is all wet?” Harris said one foul word that '\n"," 'completely disposed of Dennis and anything he might say. Peebles said, '\n"," '“It’ll be all right. Dennis an’ his popeyed friend’ll hang together, but '\n"," 'they don’t amount to anything. Chub’ll do whatever he’s argued into.” “So '\n"," 'you got ’em all lined up, hey?” Tom shrugged. “In the meantime, are we going '\n"," 'to get an airfield built?” “We’ll get it built,” Peebles said. “Only—Tom, I '\n"," 'got no right to give you any advice, but go easy on the rough stuff after '\n"," 'this. It does a lot of harm.” “I will if I can,” said Tom gruffly. They '\n"," 'broke up and turned in. Peebles was right. It did do harm. It made Dennis '\n"," 'use the word “murder” when they found, in the morning, that Rivera had died '\n"," 'during the night. The work progressed in spite of everything that had '\n"," 'happened. With equipment like that, it’s hard to slow things down. Kelly bit '\n"," 'two cubic yards out of the bluff with every swing of the big shovel, and '\n"," 'Dumptors are the fastest short-haul earth movers yet devised. Dennis kept '\n"," 'the service road clean for them with his pan, and Tom and Chub spelled each '\n"," 'other on the bulldozer they had detached from its pan to make up for the '\n"," 'lack of the Seven, spending their alternate periods with transit and stakes. '\n"," 'Peebles was rod-man for the surveys, and in between times worked on setting '\n"," 'up his field shop, keeping the water cooler and battery chargers running, '\n"," 'and lining up his forge and welding tables. The operators fueled and '\n"," 'serviced their own equipment, and there was little delay. Rocks and marl '\n"," 'came out of the growing cavity in the side of the central mesa—a whole third '\n"," 'of it had to come out— were spun down to the edge of the swamp, which lay '\n"," 'across the lower end of the projected runway, in the hornet-howling '\n"," 'Killdozer 29 dump-tractors, their big driving wheels churning up vast clouds '\n"," 'of dust, and were dumped and spread and walked in by the whining two-cycle '\n"," 'dozer. When muck began to pile up in front of the fill, it was blasted out '\n"," 'of the way with carefully placed charges of sixty percent dynamite and the '\n"," 'craters filled with rocks and stone from the ruins, and surfaced with easily '\n"," 'compacting marl, run out of a clean deposit by the pan. And when he had his '\n"," 'shop set up, Peebles went up the hill to get the Seven. When he got to it he '\n"," 'just stood there for a moment scratching his head, and then, shaking his '\n"," 'head, he ambled back down the hill and went for Tom. “Been looking at the '\n"," 'Seven,” he said, when he had flagged the moaning two-cycle and Tom had '\n"," 'climbed off. “What’d you find?” Peebles held out an arm. “A list as long as '\n"," 'that.” He shook his head. “Tom, what really happened up there?” “Governor '\n"," 'went haywire and she run away,” Tom said promptly, deadpan. “Yeah, but—” For '\n"," 'a long moment he held Tom’s eyes. Then he sighed. “O. K., Tom. Anyhow, I '\n"," 'can’t do a thing up there. We’ll have to bring her back and I’ll have to '\n"," 'have this tractor to tow her down. And first I have to have some help—the '\n"," 'track idler adjustment bolt’s busted and the right track is off the track '\n"," 'rollers.” “Oh-h-h. So that’s why she couldn’t get to the kid, running on the '\n"," 'starting motor. Track would hardly turn, hey?” “It’s a miracle she ran as '\n"," 'far as she did. That track is really jammed up. Riding right up on the '\n"," 'roller flanges. And that ain’t the half of it. The head’s gone, like Harris '\n"," 'said, and Lord only knows what I’ll find when I open her up.” “Why bother?” '\n"," '“What?” “We can get along without that dozer,” said Tom suddenly. “Leave her '\n"," 'where she is. There’s lots more for you to do.” “But what for?” “Well, '\n"," 'there’s no call to go to all that trouble.” Peebles scratched the side of '\n"," 'his nose and said, “I got a new head, track master pins—even a spare '\n"," 'starting motor. I got tools to make what I don’t stock.” He pointed at the '\n"," 'long row of dumps left by the hurtling dump-tractors while they had been '\n"," 'talking. “You got a pan tied up because you’re using this machine to doze '\n"," 'with, and you can’t tell me you can’t use 30 Theodore Sturgeon v another '\n"," 'one. You’re gonna have to shut down one or two o’ those Dumptors if you go '\n"," 'on like this.” “I had all that figured out as soon as I opened my mouth,” '\n"," 'Tom said sullenly. “Let’s go.” They climbed on the tractor and took off, '\n"," 'stopping for a moment at the beach outcropping to pick up a cable and some '\n"," 'tools. « Daisy Etta sat at the edge of the mesa, glowering out of her '\n"," 'stilted headlights at the soft sward which still bore the impression of a '\n"," 'young body and the tramplings of the stretcher-bearers. Her general aspect '\n"," 'was woebegone—there were scratches on her olive-drab paint and the bright '\n"," 'metal of the scratches was already dulled red by the earliest powder-rust. '\n"," 'And though the ground was level, she was not, for her right track was off '\n"," 'its lower rollers, and she stood slightly canted, like a man who has had a '\n"," 'broken hip. And whatever passed for consciousness within her mulled over '\n"," 'that paradox of the bulldozer that every operator must go through while he '\n"," 'is learning his own machine. It is the most difficult thing of all for the '\n"," 'beginner to understand, that paradox. A bulldozer is a crawling powerhouse, '\n"," 'a behemoth of noise and toughness, the nearest thing to the famous '\n"," 'irresistible force. The beginner, awed and with the pictures of '\n"," 'unconquerable Army tanks printed on his mind from the newsreels, takes all '\n"," 'in his stride and with a sense of limitless power treats all obstacles '\n"," 'alike, not knowing the fragility of a cast-iron radiator core, the mortality '\n"," 'of tempered manganese, the friability of over-heated babbitt, and most of '\n"," 'all, the ease with which a tractor can bury itself in mud. Climbing off to '\n"," 'stare at a machine which he has reduced in twenty seconds to a useless hulk, '\n"," 'or which was running a halfminute before on ground where it now has its '\n"," 'tracks out of sight, he has that sense of guilty disappointment which '\n"," 'overcomes any man on having made an error in judgment. So, as she stood, '\n"," 'Daisy Etta was broken and useless. These soft persistent bipeds had built '\n"," 'her, and if they were like any other race that built machines, they could '\n"," 'care for them. The ability to reverse the tension of a spring, or twist a '\n"," 'control rod, or reduce to zero the friction in a nut and lock-washer, was '\n"," 'not enough to repair the crack in a cylinder head nor bearings welded to a '\n"," 'crankshaft in an overheated starting Killdozer 31 motor. There had been a '\n"," 'lesson to learn. It had been learned. Daisy Etta would be repaired, and the '\n"," 'next time—well, at least she would know her own weaknesses. Tom swung the '\n"," 'two-cycle machine and edged in next to the Seven, with the edge of his blade '\n"," 'all but touching Daisy Etta’s push-beam. They got off and Peebles bent over '\n"," 'the drum-tight right track. “Watch yourself,” said Tom. “Watch what?” '\n"," '“Oh—nothin’, I guess.” He circled the machine, trained eyes probing over '\n"," 'frame and fittings. He stepped forward suddenly and grasped the fuel-tank '\n"," 'drain cock. It was closed. He opened it; golden oil gushed out. He shut it '\n"," 'off, climbed up on the machine and opened the fuel cap on top of the tank. '\n"," 'He pulled out the bayonet gauge, wiped it in the crook of his knee, dipped '\n"," 'and withdrew it. The tank was more than three quarters full. “What’s the '\n"," 'matter?” asked Peebles, staring curiously at Tom’s drawn face. “Peeby, I '\n"," 'opened the cock to drain this tank. I left it with oil runnin’ out on the '\n"," 'ground. She shut herself off.” “Now, Tom, you’re lettin’ this thing get you '\n"," 'down. You just thought you did. I’ve seen a main-line valve shut itself off '\n"," 'when it’s worn bad, but only ’cause the fuel pump pulls it shut when the '\n"," 'motor’s runnin’. But not a gravity drain.” “Main-line valve?” Tom pulled the '\n"," 'seat up and looked. One glance was enough to show him that this one was '\n"," 'open. “She opened this one, too.” “O. K.—O. K. Don’t look at me like that!” '\n"," 'Peebles was as near to exasperation as he could possibly get. “What '\n"," 'difference does it make?” 4 Tom did not answer. He was not the type of man '\n"," 'who, when faced .with something beyond his understanding, would begin to '\n"," 'doubt his own sanity. His was a dogged insistence that what he saw and '\n"," 'sensed was what had actually happened. In him was none of the fainting fear '\n"," 'of madness that another, more sensitive, man might feel. He doubted neither '\n"," 'himself nor his evidence, and so could free his mind for searching out the '\n"," 'consuming “why” of a problem. He knew instinctively that to share '\n"," '“unbelievable” happenings with anyone else, even if they had really '\n"," 'occurred, was to put even further obstacles 32 Theodore Sturgeon in his way. '\n"," 'So he kept his clamlike silence and stubbornly, watchfully, investigated. '\n"," 'The slipped track was so tightly drawn up on the roller flanges that there '\n"," 'could be no question of pulling the master pin and opening the track up. It '\n"," 'would have to be worked back in place—a very delicate operation, for a '\n"," 'little force applied in the wrong direction would be enough to run the track '\n"," 'off altogether. To complicate things, the blade of the Seven was down on the '\n"," 'ground and would have to be lifted before the machine could be maneuvered, '\n"," 'and its hydraulic -hoist was useless without the motor. Peebles unhooked '\n"," 'twenty feet of half-inch cable from the rear of the smaller dozer, scratched '\n"," 'a hole in the ground under the Seven’s blade, and pushed the eye of the '\n"," 'cable through. Climbing over the moldboard, he slipped the eye on to the big '\n"," 'towing hook bolted to the underside of the belly-guard. The other end of the '\n"," 'cable he threw out on the ground in front of the machine. Tom mounted the '\n"," 'other dozer and swung into place, ready to tow. Peebles hooked the cable '\n"," 'onto Tom’s drawbar, hopped up on the Seven. He put her in neutral, '\n"," 'disengaged the master clutch, and put the blade control over into “float” '\n"," 'position, then raised an arm. Tom perched upon the arm rest of his machine, '\n"," 'looking backwards, moved slowly, taking up the slack in the cable. It '\n"," 'straightened and grew taut, and as it did it forced the Seven’s blade '\n"," 'upward. Peebles waved for slack and put the blade control into “hold.” The '\n"," 'cable bellied downward away from the blade. “Hydraulic system’s O. K., '\n"," 'anyhow,” called Peebles, as Tom throttled down. “Move over and take a strain '\n"," 'to the right, sharp as you can without foul|pg the cable on the track. We’ll '\n"," 'see if we can walk this track back on.” Tom b^-ked up, cut sharply to the '\n"," 'right, apd drew the cable out almost at right angles to the other machine. '\n"," 'Peebles held the right track of the Seven with the brake and released both '\n"," 'steering clutches. The left track now could turn free, the right not at all. '\n"," 'Tom was running at a quarter throttle in his lowest gear, so that his '\n"," 'machine barely crept along, taking the strain. The Seven shook gently and '\n"," 'began to pivot on the taut right track, unbelievable foot-pounds of energy '\n"," 'coming to bear on the front of the track where it rode high up on the idler '\n"," 'wheel. Peebles released the right brake with his foot Killdozer 33 and '\n"," 'applied it again in a series of skilled, deft jerks. The track would move a '\n"," 'few inches and stop again, force being applied forward and sideward '\n"," 'alternately, urging the track persuasively back in place. Then, a little '\n"," 'jolt and she was in, riding true on the five truck rollers, the two track '\n"," 'carrier rollers, the driving sprocket and the idler. Peebles got off and '\n"," 'stuck his head in between the sprocket and the rear carrier, squinting down '\n"," 'and sideways to see if there were any broken flanges or roller bushes. Tom '\n"," 'came over and pulled him out by the seat of his trousers. “Time enough for '\n"," 'that when you get her in the shop,” he said, masking his nervousness. '\n"," '“Reckon she’ll roll?” “She’ll roll. I never saw a track in that condition '\n"," 'come back that easy. By gosh, it’s as if she was tryin’ to help!” “They’ll '\n"," 'do it sometimes,” said Tom, stiffly. “You better take the tow-tractor, '\n"," 'Peeby. I’ll stay with this’n.” “Anything you say.” And cautiously they took '\n"," 'the steep slope down. Tom barely holding the brakes, giving the other '\n"," 'machine a straight pull all the way. And so they brought Daisy Etta down to '\n"," 'Peebles’ outdoor shop, where they pulled her cylinder head off, took off her '\n"," 'starting motor, pulled out a burned clutch facing, had her quite helpless— '\n"," 'And put her together again. “I tell you it was outright, cold-blooded '\n"," 'murder,” said Dennis hotly. “An’ here we are takin’ orders from a guy like '\n"," 'that. What are we goin’ to do about it?” They were standing by the '\n"," 'cooler—Dennis had run his machine there to waylay Chub. Chub Horton’s cigar '\n"," 'went down and up like a semaphore with a short circuit. “We’ll skip it. The '\n"," 'blacktopping crew will be here in another two weeks or so, an’ we can make a '\n"," 'report. Besides, I don’t know what happened up there any more than you do. '\n"," 'In the meantime we got a runway to build.” “You don’t know what happened up '\n"," 'there? Chub, you’re a smart man. Smart enough to run this job better than '\n"," 'Tom Jaeger even if he wasn’t crazy. And you’re surely smart enough not to '\n"," 'believe all that cock and bull about that tractor runnin’ out from under '\n"," 'that grease-monkey. Listen—” he leaned fqjward and tapped Chub’s chest. “He '\n"," 'said it was 34 Theodore Sturgeon the governor. I saw that governor myself '\n"," 'an’ heard oP Peebles say there wasn’t a thing wrong with it. Th’ throttle '\n"," 'control rod had slipped off its yoke, yeah—but you know what a tractor will '\n"," 'do when the throttle control goes out. It’ll idle or stall. It won’t run '\n"," 'away, whatever.” “Well, maybe so, but—” “But nothin’! A guy that’ll commit '\n"," 'murder ain’t sane. If he did it once, he can do it again and I ain’t ffxin’ '\n"," 'to let that happen to me.” Two things crossed Chub’s steady but not too '\n"," 'bright mind at this. One was that Dennis, whom he did not like but could not '\n"," 'shake, was trying to force him into something that he did not want to do. '\n"," 'The other was that under all of his swift talk Dennis was scared spitless. '\n"," '“What do you want to do—call up the sheriff?” Dennis ha-ha-ed '\n"," 'appreciatively—one of the reasons he was so hard to shake. “I’ll tell you '\n"," 'what we can do. As long as we have you here, he isn’t the only man who knows '\n"," 'the work. If we stop takin’ orders from him, you can give ’em as good or '\n"," 'better. An’ there won’t be anything he can do about it.” “Doggone it, '\n"," 'Dennis,” said Chub, with sudden exasperation. “What do you think you’re '\n"," 'doin’—handin’ me over the keys to the kingdom or something? What do you want '\n"," 'to see me bossin’ around here for?” He stood up. “Suppose we did what you '\n"," 'said? Would it get the field built any quicker? Would it get me any more '\n"," 'money in my pay envelope? What do you think I want—glory? I passed up a '\n"," 'chance to run for councilman once. You think I’d raise a finger to get a '\n"," 'bunch of mugs to do what I say—when they do it anyway?” “Aw, Chub—I wouldn’t '\n"," 'cause trouble just for the fun of it. That’s not what I mean at all. But '\n"," 'unless we do something about that guy we ain’t safe. Can’t you get that '\n"," 'through your head?” “Listen, windy. If a man keeps busy enough he can’t get '\n"," 'into trouble. That goes for Tom—you might keep that in mind. But it goes for '\n"," 'you, too. Get back up on that rig an’ get back to the marl pit.” Dennis, '\n"," 'completely taken by surprise, turned to his machine. “It’s a pity you can’t '\n"," 'move earth with your mouth,” said Chub as he walked off. “They could have '\n"," 'left you to do this job singlehanded.” Chub walked slowly toward the '\n"," 'outcropping, switching at Killdozer 35 >each pebbles with a grade stake and '\n"," 'swearing to himself. He vas essentially a simple man and believed in the '\n"," 'simplest possible approach to everything. He liked a job where he could lo '\n"," 'everything required and where nothing turned up to com-jlicate things. He '\n"," 'had been in the grading business for a long ime as an operator and survey '\n"," 'party boss, and he was re-narkable for one thing—he had always held aloof '\n"," 'from the cliques and internecine politics that are the breath of life to '\n"," 'nost construction men. He was disturbed and troubled at the jack-stabbing '\n"," 'that went on around him on various jobs. If it ivas blunt, he was disgusted, '\n"," 'and subtlety simply left him foundering and bewildered. He was stupid enough '\n"," 'so that his jasic honesty manifested itself in his speech and actions, and '\n"," 'le had learned that complete honesty in dealing with men above and below him '\n"," 'was almost invariably painful to all soncerned, but he had not the wit to '\n"," 'act otherwise, and did not try to. If he had a bad tooth, he had it pulled '\n"," 'out as soon as he could. If he got a raw deal from a superintendent over '\n"," 'him, that superintendent would get told exactly what the trouble was, and if '\n"," 'he didn’t like it, there were other jobs. And if the pulling and hauling of '\n"," 'cliques got in his hair, he had always said so and left. Or he had sounded '\n"," 'off and stayed; his completely selfish reaction to things that got in the '\n"," 'way of his work had earned him a lot of regard from men he had worked under. '\n"," 'And so, in this instance, he had no hesitation about choosing a course of '\n"," 'action. Only—how did you go about asking a man if he was a murderer? He '\n"," 'found the foreman with an enormous wrench in his hand, tightening up the new '\n"," 'track adjustment bolt they had installed in the Seven. “Hey, Chub! Glad you '\n"," 'turned up. Let’s get a piece of pipe over the end of this thing and really '\n"," 'bear down.” Chub went for the pipe, and they fitted it over the handle of '\n"," 'the four-foot wrench and hauled until the sweat ran down their backs, Tom '\n"," 'checking the track clearance occasionally with a crowbar. He finally called '\n"," 'it good enough and they stood there in the sun gasping for breath. “Tom,” '\n"," 'panted Chub, “did you kill that Puerto Rican?” Tom’s head came up as if '\n"," 'someone had burned the back of his neck with a cigarette. “Because,” said '\n"," 'Chub, “if you did you can’t go on runnin’ this job.” 36 Theodore Sturgeon '\n"," 'Tom said, “That’s a lousy thing to kid about.” “You know I ain’t kiddin’. '\n"," 'Well, did you?” “No!” Tom sat down on a keg, wiped his face with a bandanna. '\n"," '“What’s got into you?” “I just wanted to know. Some of the boys are worried '\n"," 'about it.” Tom’s eyes narrowed. “Some of the boys, huh? I think I get it. '\n"," 'Listen to me, Chub. Rivera was killed by that thing there.” He thumbed over '\n"," 'his shoulder at the Seven, which was standing ready now, awaiting only the '\n"," 'building of a broken cutting corner on the blade. Peebles was winding up the '\n"," 'welding machine as he spoke. “If you mean, did I put him up on the machine '\n"," 'before he was thrown, the answer is yes. That much I killed him, and don’t '\n"," 'think I don’t feel it. I had a hunch something was wrong up there, but I '\n"," 'couldn’t put my finger on it and I certainly didn’t think anybody was going '\n"," 'to get hurt.” “Well, what was wrong?” “I still don’t know.” Tom stood up. '\n"," '“I’m tired of beatin’ around the bush, Chub, and I don’t much care any more '\n"," 'what anybody thinks. There’s somethin’ wrong with that Seven, something that '\n"," 'wasn’t built into her. They don’t make tractors better’n that one, but '\n"," 'whatever it was happened up there on the mesa has queered this one. Now go '\n"," 'ahead and think what you like, and dream up any story you want to tell the '\n"," 'boys. In the meantime you can pass the word—nobody runs that machine but me, '\n"," 'understand? Nobody!” “Tom—” Tom’s patience broke. “That’s all I’m going to '\n"," 'say about it! If anybody else gets hurt, it’s going to be me, understand? '\n"," 'What more do you want?” He strode off, boiling. Chub stared after him, and '\n"," 'after a long moment reached up and took the cigar from his lips. Only then '\n"," 'did he realize that he had bitten it in two; half the butt was still inside '\n"," 'his mouth. He spat and stood there shaking his head. “How’s she going, '\n"," 'Peeby?” Peebles looked up from the welding machine. “Hi, Chub, have her '\n"," 'ready for you in twenty minutes.” He gauged the distance between the welding '\n"," 'machine and the big tractor. “I should have forty feet of cable,” he said, '\n"," 'looking at the Killdozer 37 festoons of arc and ground cables that hung from '\n"," 'the storage hooks in the back of the welder. “Don’t want to get a tractor '\n"," 'over here to move the thing, and don’t feel like cranking up the Seven just '\n"," 'to get it close enough.” He separated the arc cable and threw it aside, '\n"," 'walked to the tractor, paying the ground cable off his arm. He threw out the '\n"," 'last of his slack and grasped the ground clamp when he was eight feet from '\n"," 'the machine. Taking it in his left hand, he pulled hard, reaching out with '\n"," 'his right to grasp the moldboard of the Seven, trying to get it far enough '\n"," 'to clamp on to the machine. Chub stood there watching him, chewing on his '\n"," 'cigar, absent-mindedly diddling with the controls on the arc-welder. He '\n"," 'pressed the starter-button, and the six-cylinder motor responded with a '\n"," 'purr. He spun the work-selector dials idly, threw the arc generator switch— '\n"," 'A bolt of incredible energy, thin, searing, blue-white, left the rod-holder '\n"," 'at his feet, stretched itself fifty feet across to Peebles, whose fingers '\n"," 'had just touched the moldboard of the tractor. Peebles’ head and shoulders '\n"," 'were surrounded for a second by a violet nimbus, and then he folded over and '\n"," 'dropped. A circuit breaker clacked behind the control board of the welder, '\n"," 'but too late. The Seven rolled slowly backward, without firing, on level '\n"," 'ground, until it brought up against a road-roller. Chub’s cigar was gone, '\n"," 'and he didn’t notice if. He had the knuckles of his right hand in his mouth, '\n"," 'and his teeth sunk into the pudgy flesh. His eyes protruded; he crouched '\n"," 'there and quivered, literally frightened out of his mind. For old Peebles '\n"," 'was burned almost in two. They buried him next to Rivera. There wasn’t much '\n"," 'talk afterwards; the old man had been a lot closer to all of them than they '\n"," 'had realized until now. Harris, for once in his rum-dumb, lightheaded life, '\n"," 'was quiet and serious, and Kelly’s walk seemed to lose some of its '\n"," 'litheness. Hour after hour Dennis’ flabby mouth worked, and he bit at his '\n"," 'lower lip until it was swollen and tender. A1 Knowles seemed more or less '\n"," 'unaffected, as was to be expected from a man who had something less than the '\n"," 'brains of a chicken. Chub Horton had snapped out of it after a couple of '\n"," 'hours and was very nearly himself again. And in Tom Jaeger swirled a black, '\n"," 'furious anger at this unknowable curse that had struck thd camp. 38 Theodore '\n"," 'Sturgeon And they kept working. There was nothing else to do. The shovel '\n"," 'kept up its rhythmic swing and dig, swing and dump, and the Dumptors '\n"," 'screamed back and forth between it and the little that there was left of the '\n"," 'swamp. The upper end of the runway was grassed off; Chub and Tom set grade '\n"," 'stakes and Dennis began the long job of cutting and filling the humpy '\n"," 'surface with his pan. Harris manned the other and followed him, a cut '\n"," 'behind. The shape of the runway emerged from the land, and then that of the '\n"," 'paralleling taxiway; and three days went by. The horror of Peebles’ death '\n"," 'wore off enough so that they could talk about it, and very little of the '\n"," 'talk helped anybody. Tom took his spells at everything, changing over with '\n"," 'Kelly to give him a rest from the shovel, making a few rounds with a pan, '\n"," 'putting in hours on a Dumptor. His arm was healing slowly but clean, and he '\n"," 'worked grimly in spite of it, taking a perverse sort of pleasure from the '\n"," 'pain of it. Every man on the job watched his machine with the solicitude of '\n"," 'a mother with her first-born; a serious breakdown would have been disastrous '\n"," 'without a highly skilled mechanic. The only concession that Tom allowed '\n"," 'himself in regard to Peebles’ death was to corner Kelly one afternoon and '\n"," 'ask him about the welding machine. Part of Kelly’s rather patchy past had '\n"," 'been spent in a technical college, where he had studied electrical '\n"," 'engineering and women. He had learned a little of the former and enough of '\n"," 'the latter to get him thrown out on his ear. So, on the off-chance that he '\n"," 'might know something about the freak arc, Tom put it to him. Kelly pulled '\n"," 'off his high-gauntlet gloves and batted sandflies with them. “What sort of '\n"," 'an arc was that? Boy, you got me there. Did you ever hear of a welding '\n"," 'machine doing like that before?” “I did not. A welding machine just don’t '\n"," 'have that sort o’ push. I saw a man get a full jolt from a 400-amp welder '\n"," 'once, an’ although it sat him down it didn’t hurt him any.” “It’s-not '\n"," 'amperage that kills people,” said Kelly, “it’s voltage. Voltage is the '\n"," 'pressure behind a current, you know. Take an amount of water, call it '\n"," 'amperage. If I throw it in your face, it won’t hurt you. If I put it through '\n"," 'a small hose you’ll feel it. But if I pump it through them tiny holes on a '\n"," 'Diesel injector nozzle at about twelve hundred pounds, it’ll draw blood. But '\n"," 'a welding arc generator just is not wound Killdozer 39 o build up that kind '\n"," 'of voltage. I can’t see where any short ircuit anywhere through the armature '\n"," 'or field windings could lo such a thing.” “From what Chub said, he had been '\n"," 'foolin’ around with he work selector. I don’t think anyone touched the dials '\n"," 'ifter it happened. The selector dial was run all the way over o the low '\n"," 'current application segment, and the current con-rol was around the halfway '\n"," 'mark. That’s not enough juice o get you a good bead with a quarter-inch rod, '\n"," 'let alone kill somebody—or roll a tractor back thirty feet on level ground.” '\n"," '“Or jump fifty feet,” said Kelly. “It would take thousands >f volts to '\n"," 'generate an arc like that.” “Is it possible that something in the Seven '\n"," 'could have mlled that arc? I mean, suppose the arc wasn’t driven over, jut '\n"," 'was drawn over? I tell you, she was hot for four hours ifter that.” Kelly '\n"," 'shook his head. “Never heard of any such thing. Look, just to have something '\n"," 'to call them, we call direct current terminals positive and negative, and '\n"," 'just because it vorks in theory we say that current flows from negative to '\n"," 'positive. There couldn’t-be any more positive attraction in one jlectrode '\n"," 'than there is negative drive in the other; see what [ mean?” “There couldn’t '\n"," 'be some freak condition that would cause a sort of oversize positive field? '\n"," 'I mean one that would suck out the negative flow all in a heap, make it '\n"," 'smash through under a lot of pressure like the water you were talking about '\n"," 'through an injector nozzle?” “No, Tom. It just don’t work that way, far as '\n"," 'anyone knows. I dunno, though—there are some things about static electricity '\n"," 'that nobody understands. All I can say is that what happened couldn’t happen '\n"," 'and if it did it couldn’t have killed Peebles. And you know the answer to '\n"," 'that.” Tom glanced away at the upper end of the runway, where the two graves '\n"," 'were. There was bitterness and turbulent anger naked there for a moment, and '\n"," 'he turned and walked away without another word. And when he went back to '\n"," 'have another look at the welding machine, Daisy Etta was gone. A1 Knowles '\n"," 'and Harris squatted together near the water cooler. “Bad,” said Harris. 40 '\n"," 'Theodore Sturgeon “Nevah saw anythin’ like it,” said Al. “Ol’ Tom come back '\n"," 'fm the shop theah jus’ raisin’ Cain. ‘Weah’s ’at Seven gone? Weah’s ’at '\n"," 'Seven?’ I never heered sech cah’ins on.” “Dennis did take it, huh?” '\n"," '“Sho’did.” - Harris said, “He came spoutin’ around to me a while back, '\n"," 'Dennis did. Chub’d told him Tom said for everybody to stay off that machine. '\n"," 'Dennis was mad as a wet hen. Said Tom was carryin’ that kind o’ business too '\n"," 'far. Said there was probably somethin’ about the Seven Tom didn’t want us to '\n"," 'find out. Might incriminate him. Dennis is ready to say Tom killed the kid,” '\n"," '“Reckon he did, Harris?” Harris shook his head. “I’ve known Tom too long to '\n"," 'think that. If he won’t tell us what really happened up on the mesa, he has '\n"," 'a reason for it. How’d Dennis come to take the dozer?” “Blew a front tire on '\n"," 'his pan. Came back heah to git anothah rig—maybe a Dumptor. Saw th’ Seven '\n"," 'standin’ theah ready to go. Stood theah lookin’ at it and cussin’ Tom. Said '\n"," 'he was tired of bashin’ his kidneys t’pieces on them othah rigs an’ bedamned '\n"," 'if he wouldn’t take suthin’ that rode good fo’ a change. I tol’ him ol’ '\n"," 'Tom’d raise th’ roof when he found him on it. He had a couple mo’ things '\n"," 't’say ’bout Tom then.” “I didn’t think he had the guts to take the rig.” '\n"," '“Aw, he talked hisself blind mad.” They looked up as Chub Horton trotted up, '\n"," 'panting. “Hey, you guys, come on. We better get up there to Dennis.” “What’s '\n"," 'wrong?” asked Harris, climbing to his feet. “Tom passed me a minute ago '\n"," 'lookin’ like the wrath o’ God and hightailin’ it for the swamp fill. I asked '\n"," 'him what was the matter and he hollered that Dennis had taken the Seven. '\n"," 'Said he was always talkin’ about murder and he’d get his fill of it foolin’ '\n"," 'around that machine.” Chub went wall-eyed, licked his lips beside his cigar. '\n"," '“Oh-oh,” said Harris quietly. “That’s the wrong kind o’ talk for just now.” '\n"," '“You don’t suppose he—” “Come on!\" They saw Tom before they were halfway '\n"," 'there. He was walking slowly, with his head down. Harris shouted. Tom raised '\n"," 'his face, stopped, stood there waiting with a peculiarly slumped stance. '\n"," 'Killdozer 41 “Where’s Dennis?” barked Chub. Tom waited until they were '\n"," 'almost up to him and then weakly raised an arm and thumbed over his '\n"," 'shoulder. His face was green. “Tom—is he—” Tom nodded, and swayed a little. '\n"," 'His granite jaw was slack. “Al, stay with him. He’s sick. Harris, let’s go.” '\n"," 'Tom was sick, then and there. Very. Al stood gaping at him, fascinated. Chub '\n"," 'and Harris found Dennis. All of twelve square feet of him, ground and '\n"," 'churned and rolled out into a torn-up patch of earth. Daisy Etta was gone. '\n"," 'Back at the outcropping, they sat with Tom while Al Knowles took a Dumptor '\n"," 'and roared away to get Kelly. “You saw him?” he said dully after a time. '\n"," 'Harris said, “Yeh.” The screaming Dumptor and a mountainous cloud of dust '\n"," 'arrived, Kelly driving, Al holding on with a death-grip to the dump-bed '\n"," 'guards. Kelly flung himself off, ran to Tom. “Tom —what is all this? Dennis '\n"," 'dead? And you . . . you—” Tom’s head came up slowly, the slackness going out '\n"," 'of his long face, a light suddenly coming into his eyes. Until this moment '\n"," 'it had not crossed his mind what these men might think. “I—what?” “Al says '\n"," 'you killed him.” Tom’s eyes flicked at Al Knowles, and Al winced as if the '\n"," 'glance had been a quirt. Harris said, “What about it, Tom?” “Nothing about '\n"," 'it. He was killed by that Seven. You saw that for yourself.” “I stuck with '\n"," 'you all along,” said Harris slowly. “I took everything you said and believed '\n"," 'it.” “This is too strong for you?” Tom asked. Harris nodded. “Too strong, '\n"," 'Tom.” Tom looked at the grim circle of faces and laughed suddenly. He stood '\n"," 'up, put his back against a tall crate. “What do you plan to do about it?” '\n"," 'There was a silence. “You think I went up there and knocked that windbag off '\n"," 'the machine and ran over him?” 42 Theodore Sturgeon More silence. “Listen. I '\n"," 'went up there and saw what you saw. He was dead before I got there. That’s '\n"," 'not good enough either?” He paused and licked his lips. “So after I killed '\n"," 'him I got up on the tractor and drove it far enough away so you couldn’t see '\n"," 'or hear it when you got there. And then I sprouted wings and flew back so’s '\n"," 'I was halfway here when you met me—ten minutes after I spoke to Chub on my '\n"," 'way up!” Kelly said vaguely, “Tractor?” “Well,” said Tom harshly to Harris, '\n"," '“was the tractor there when you and Chub went up and saw Dennis?” “No~” — '\n"," 'Chub smacked his thigh suddenly. “You could of drove it into the swamp, '\n"," 'Tom.” Tom said angrily, “I’m wastin’ my time. You guys got it all figured '\n"," 'out. Why ask me anything at all?” “Aw, take it easy,” said Kelly. “We just '\n"," 'want the facts. Just what did happen? You met Chub and told him that Dennis '\n"," 'would get all the murderin’ he could take if he messed around that machine. '\n"," 'That right?” “That’s right.” “Then what?” “Then the machine murdered him.” '\n"," 'Chub, with remarkable patience, asked, “What did you mean the day Peebles '\n"," 'was killed when you said that something had queered the Seven up there on '\n"," 'the mesa?” Tom said furiously, “I meant what I said. You guys are set to '\n"," 'crucify me for this and I can’t stop you. Well, listen. Something’s got into '\n"," 'that Seven. I don’t know what it is and I don’t think I ever will know. I '\n"," 'thought that after she smashed herself up that it was finished with. I had '\n"," 'an idea that when we had her torn down and helpless we should have left her '\n"," 'that way. I was dead right but it’s too late now. She’s killed Rivera and '\n"," 'she’s killed Dennis and she sure had something to do with killing Peebles. '\n"," 'And my idea is that she won’t stop as long as there’s a human being alive on '\n"," 'this ✓ island.” “Whaddaya know!” said Chub. “Sure, Tom sure,” said Kelly '\n"," 'quietly. “That tractor is out to get us. But don’t worry; we’ll catch it and '\n"," 'tear it down. Just don’t you worry about it any more; it’ll be all right.” '\n"," '“That’s right, Tom,” said Harris. “You just take it easy around camp for a '\n"," 'couple of days till you feel better. Chub Killdozer 43 and the rest of us '\n"," 'will handle things for you. You had too much sun.” I “You’re a swell bunch '\n"," 'of fellows,” gritted Tom, with the deepest sarcasm.. “You want to live,” he '\n"," 'shouted, “git out there and throw that maverick bulldozer!” “That maverick '\n"," 'bulldozer is at the bottom of the swamp where you put it,” growled Chub. His '\n"," 'head lowered and he started to move in. “Sure we want to live. The best way '\n"," 'to do that is to put you where you can’t kill anybody else. Get him!\" He '\n"," 'leaped. Tom straightened him with his left and crossed with his right. Chub '\n"," 'went down, tripping Harris. A1 Knowles scuttled to a toolbox and dipped out '\n"," 'a fourteen-inch crescent wrench. He circled around, keeping out of trouble, '\n"," 'trying to look useful. Tom loosened a haymaker at Kelly, whose head seemed '\n"," 'to withdraw like a turtle’s; it whistled over, throwing Tom badly off '\n"," 'balance. Harris, still on his knees, tackled Tom’s legs; Chub hit him in the '\n"," 'small of the back with a meaty shoulder, and Tom went flat on his face. A1 '\n"," 'Knowles, holding the wrench in both hands, swept it up and back like a '\n"," 'baseball bat; at the top of its swing Kelly reached over, snatched it out of '\n"," 'his hands and tapped Tom delicately behind the ear with it. Tom went limp. '\n"," 'It was late, but nobody seemed to feel like sleeping. They sat around the '\n"," 'pressure lantern, talking idly. Chub and Kelly played an inconsequential '\n"," 'game of casino, forgetting to pick up their points; Harris paced up and down '\n"," 'like a man in a cell, and A1 Knowles was squinched up close to the light, '\n"," 'his eyes wide and watching, watching— “I need a drink,” said Harris. “Tens,” '\n"," 'said one of the casino players. A1 Knowles said, “We shoulda killed him. We '\n"," 'oughta kill him now.” “There’s been too much killin’ already,” said Chub. '\n"," '“Shut up, you.” And to Kelly, “With big casino,” sweeping up cards. Kelly '\n"," 'caught his wrist and grinned. “Big casino’s the ten of diamonds, not the ten '\n"," 'of hearts. Remember?” “Oh.” “How long before the blacktopping crew will be '\n"," 'here?” quavered A1 Knowles. 44 Theodore Sturgeon “Twelve days,” said Harris. '\n"," '“And they better bring some likker.” “Hey, you guys.” They fell silent. '\n"," '“Hey!” “It’s Tom,” said Kelly. “Building sixes, Chub.” “I’m gonna go kick '\n"," 'his ribs in,” said Knowles, not moving. “I heard that,” said the voice from '\n"," 'the darkness. “If I wasn’t hogtied—” “We know what you’d do,” said Chub. '\n"," '“How much proof do you think we need?” “Chub, you don’t have to do any more '\n"," 'to him!” It was Kelly, flinging his cards down and getting up. “Tomr you '\n"," 'want water?” “Yes.” “Siddown, siddown,” said Chub. “Let him lay there and '\n"," 'bleed,” A1 Knowles said. “Nuts!” Kelly went and filled a cup and brought it '\n"," 'to Tom. The big Georgian was tied thoroughly, wrists together, taut rope '\n"," 'between elbow and elbo^v behind his back, so that his hands were immovable '\n"," 'over his solar plexus. His knees and ankles were bound as well, although '\n"," 'Knowles’ little idea of a short rope between ankles and throat hadn’t been '\n"," 'used. “Thanks, Kelly.” Tom drank greedily, Kelly holding his head. “Goes '\n"," 'good.” He drank more. “What hit me?” “One of the boys. ’Bout the time you '\n"," 'said the cat was haunted.” “Oh, yeah.” Tom rolled his head and blinked with '\n"," 'pain. “Any sense asking you if you blame us?” “Kelly, does somebody else '\n"," 'have to get killed before you guys wake up?” “None of us figure there will '\n"," 'be any more killin’—now.” The rest of the men drifted up. “He willing to '\n"," 'talk sense?” Chub wanted to know. A1 Knowles laughed, “Hyuk! hyuk! Don’t he '\n"," 'look dangerous now!” Harris said suddenly, “Al, I’m gonna hafta tape your '\n"," 'mouth with the skin off your neck.” “Am I the kind of guy that makes up '\n"," 'ghost stories?” “Never have that I know of, Tom.” Harris kneeled down beside '\n"," 'him. “Never killed anyone before, either.” ✓ “Oh, get away from me. Get '\n"," 'away,” said Tom tiredly. Killdozer 45 “Get up and make us,” jeered Al. '\n"," 'Harris got up and backhanded him across the mouth. Al squeaked, took three '\n"," 'steps backward and tripped over a drum of grease. “I told you,” said Harris '\n"," 'almost plaintively. “I told you, Al.” Tom stopped the bumble of comment. '\n"," '“Shut up!” he hissed. “SHUT UP!” he roared. They shut. “Chub,” said Tom, '\n"," 'rapidly, evenly. “What did you say I did with that Seven?” “Buried it in the '\n"," 'swamp.” “Yeh. Listen.” “Listen at what?” “Be quiet and listen!” y So they '\n"," 'listened. It was another still, windless night, with a thin crescent of moon '\n"," 'showing nothing true in the black and muffled silver landscape. The smallest '\n"," 'whisper of surf drifted up from the beach, and from far off to the right, '\n"," 'where the swamp was, a scandalized frog croaked protest at the manhandling '\n"," 'of his mudhole. But the sound that crept down, freezing their bones, came '\n"," 'from the bluff behind their camp. It was the unmistakable staccato of a '\n"," 'starting engine. “The Seven!” “ ’At’s right, Chub,” said Tom. “Wh-who’s '\n"," 'crankin’ her up?” “Are we all here?” “All but Peebles and Dennis and '\n"," 'Rivera,” said Tom. “It’s Dennis’ ghost,” moaned Al. Chub snapped, “Shut up, '\n"," 'lamebrain.” “She’s shifted to Diesel,” said Kelly, listening. “She’ll be '\n"," 'here in a minute,” said Tom. “Y’know, fellas, we can’t all be crazy, but '\n"," 'you’re about to have a time convincin’ yourself of it.” “You like this, '\n"," 'doncha?” “Some ways. Rivera used to call that machine Daisy Etta, ’cause '\n"," 'she’s de siete in Spig. Daisy Etta, she wants her a man.” “Tom,” said '\n"," 'Harris, “I wish you’d stop that chatterin’. You make me nervous.” “I got to '\n"," 'do somethin’. I can’t run,” Tom drawled. “We’re going to have a look,” said '\n"," 'Chub. “If there’s nobody on that cat, we’ll turn you loose.” 46 Theodore '\n"," 'Sturgeon “Mighty white of you. Reckon you’ll get back before she does?” '\n"," '“We’ll get back. Harris, come with me. We’ll get one of the pan tractors. '\n"," 'They can outrun a Seven. Kelly, take A1 and get the other one.” “Dennis’ '\n"," 'machine has a flat tire on the pan,” said Al’s quivering voice. “Pull the '\n"," 'pin and cut the cables, then! Git!” Kelly and A1 Knowles ran off. “Good '\n"," 'huntin’, Chub.” Chub went to him, bent over. “I think I’m goin’ to have to '\n"," 'apologize to you, Tom.” “No you ain’t. I’d a done the same. Get along now, '\n"," 'if you think you got to. But hurry back.” “I got to. An’ I’ll hurry back.” '\n"," 'Harris said, “Don’t go ’way, boy.” Tom returned the grin, and they were '\n"," 'gone. But they didn’t hurry back. They didn’t come back at all. It was Kelly '\n"," 'who came pounding back, with A1 Knowles on his heels, a half hour later. '\n"," '“A1—gimme your knife.” He went to work on the ropes. His face was drawn. “I '\n"," 'could see some of it,” whispered Tom. “Chub and Harris?” Kelly nodded. '\n"," '“There wasn’t nobody on the Seven like you said.” He said it as if there was '\n"," 'nothing else in his mind, as if the most rigid self-control was keeping him '\n"," 'from saying it over and over. “I could see the lights,” said Tom. “A tractor '\n"," 'angling up the hill. Pretty soon another, crossing it, lighting up the whole '\n"," 'slope.” “We heard it idling up there somewhere,” Kelly said. “Olive-drab '\n"," 'paint—couldn’t see it.” “I saw the pan tractor turn over—oh, four, five '\n"," 'times down the hill. It stopped, lights still burning. Then something hit it '\n"," 'and rolled it again. That sure blacked it out. What turned it over first?” '\n"," '“The Seven. Hanging up there just at the brow of the bluff. Waited until '\n"," 'Chub and Harris were about to pass, sixty, seventy feet below. Tipped over '\n"," 'the edge and rolled down on them with her clutches out. Must’ve been going '\n"," 'thirty miles an hour when she hit. Broadside. They never had a chance. '\n"," 'Killdozer 47 Followed the pan as it rolled down the hill and when it stopped '\n"," 'booted it again.” “Want me to rub yo’ ankles?” asked Al. “You! Get outa my '\n"," 'sight!” “Aw, Tom—” whimpered Al. “Skip it, Tom,” said Kelly. “There ain’t '\n"," 'enough of us left to carry on that way. Al, you mind your manners from here '\n"," 'on out, hear?” “Ah jes’ wanted to tell y’all. I knew you weren’t lyin’ ’bout '\n"," 'Dennis, Tom, if only I’d stopped to think. I recollect when Dennis said he’d '\n"," 'take that tractuh out . . . ’membah, Kelly? . . . He went an’ got the crank '\n"," 'and walked around to th’ side of th’ machine and stuck it in th’ hole. It '\n"," 'was barely in theah befo’ the startin’ engine kicked off. ‘Whadda ya know!’ '\n"," 'he says t’me. ‘She started by herse’f! I nevah pulled that handle!’ And I '\n"," 'said, ‘She sho’ rarin’ t’go!’ ” “You pick a fine time to ‘recollec’ ’ '\n"," 'something,” gritted Tom. “C’mon—let’s get out of here.” “Where to?” “What do '\n"," 'you know that a Seven can’t move or get up on?” “That’s a large order. A big '\n"," 'rock, maybe.” “Ain’t nothing that big around here,” said Tom. Kelly thought '\n"," 'a minute, then snapped his fingers. “Up on the top of my last cut with the '\n"," 'shovel,” he said. “It’s fourteen feet if it’s an inch. I was pullin’ out '\n"," 'small rock an’ topsoil, and Chub told me to drop back and dip out marl from '\n"," 'a pocket there. I sumped in back of the original cut and took out a whole '\n"," 'mess o’ marl. That left a big neck of earth sticking thirty feet or so out '\n"," 'of the cliff. The narrowest part is only about four feet wide. If Daisy Etta '\n"," 'tries to get us from the top, she’ll straddle the neck and hang herself. If '\n"," 'she tries to get us from below, she can’t get traction to climb; it’s too '\n"," 'loose and too steep.” “And what happens if she builds herself a ramp?” '\n"," '“We’ll be gone from there.” “Let’s go.” Al agitated for the choice of a '\n"," 'Dumptor because of its speed, but was howled down. Tom wanted something that '\n"," 'could not get a flat tire and that would need something really powerful to '\n"," 'turn it over. They took the two-cycle pan tractor with the bulldozer blade '\n"," 'that had been Dennis’ machine and crept out into the darkness. 48 Theodore '\n"," 'Sturgeon It was nearly six hours later that Daisy Etta came and woke them '\n"," 'up. Night was receding before a paleness in the east, and a fresh ocean '\n"," 'breeze had sprung up. Kelly had taken the first lookout and A1 the second, '\n"," 'letting Tom rest the night out. And Tom was far too tired to argue the '\n"," 'arrangement. A1 had immediately fallen asleep on his watch, but fear had '\n"," 'such a sure, cold hold on his vitals that the first faint growl of the big '\n"," 'Diesel engine snapped him erect. He tottered oh the edge of the tall neck of '\n"," 'earth that they slept on and squeaked as he scrabbled to get his balance. '\n"," '“What’s giving?” asked Kelly, instantly wide awake. “It’s coming,” blubbered '\n"," 'Al. “Oh my, oh my—” Kelly stood up and stared into the fresh, dark dawn. The '\n"," 'motor boomed hollowly, in a peculiar way heard twice at the same time as it '\n"," 'was thrown to them and echoed back by the bluffs under and around them. '\n"," '“It’s coming and what are we goin’ to do?” chanted Al. “What is going to '\n"," 'happen?” “My head is going to fall off,” said Tom sleepily. He rolled to a '\n"," 'sitting position, holding the brutalized member between his hands. “If that '\n"," 'egg behind my ear hatches, it’ll come out a full-sized jack-hammer.” He '\n"," 'looked at Kelly. “Where is she?” “Don’t rightly know,” said Kelly. '\n"," '“Somewhere down around the camp.” “Probably pickin’ up our scent.” “Figure '\n"," 'it can do that?” “I figure it can do anything,” said Tom. “Al, stop your '\n"," 'moanin’.” The sun slipped its scarlet edge into the thin slot between sea '\n"," 'and sky, and rosy light gave each rock and tree a shape and a shadow. '\n"," 'Kelly’s gaze swept back and forth, back and forth, until, minutes later, he '\n"," 'saw movement. “There she is!” “Where?” “Down by the grease rack.” Tom rose '\n"," 'and stared. “What’s she doin’?” After an interval Kelly said, “She’s '\n"," 'workin’. Diggin’ a swale in front of the fuel drums.” “You don’t say. Don’t '\n"," 'tell me she’s goin’ to give herself a vgrease job.” / “She don’t need it. '\n"," 'She was completely greased and new oil Killdozer 49 put in the crankcase '\n"," 'after we set her up. But she might need fuel.” “Not more’n half a tank.” '\n"," '“Well, maybe she figures she’s got a lot of work to do today.” As Kelly said '\n"," 'this A1 began to blubber. They ignored him. The fuel drums were piled in a '\n"," 'pyramid at the edge of the camp, in forty-four-gallon drums piled on their '\n"," 'sides. The Seven was moving back and forth in front of them, close up, '\n"," 'making pass after pass, gouging earth up and wasting it out past the pile. '\n"," 'She soon had a huge pit scooped out, about fourteen feet wide, six. feet '\n"," 'deep and thirty feet long, right at the very edge of the pile of drums. '\n"," '“What you reckon she’s playin’ at?” “Search me. She seems to want fuel, but '\n"," 'I don’t . . . look at that! She’s stopped in the hole;. . . turnin’ . . . '\n"," 'smashing the top comer of the moldboard into one of the drums on the '\n"," 'bottom!” Tom scraped the stubble on his jaw with his nails. “An’ you wonder '\n"," 'how much that critter can do! Why, she’s got the whole thing figured out. '\n"," 'She knows if she tried to punch a hole in a fuel drum that she’d only kick '\n"," 'it around. If she did knock a hole in it, how’s she going to lift it? She’s '\n"," 'not equipped to handle hose, so . . . see? Look at her now! She just get '\n"," 'herself lower than the bottom drum on the pile, and punches a hole. She can '\n"," 'do that then, with the whole weight of the pile holding it down. Then she '\n"," 'backs her tank under the stream of fuel runnin’ out!” “How’d she get the cap '\n"," 'off?” Tom snorted and told them how the radiator cap had come off its hinges '\n"," 'as he vaulted over the hood the day Rivera was hurt. , “You know,” he said '\n"," 'after a moment’s thought, “if she knew as much then as she does now, I’d be '\n"," 'snoozin’ beside Rivera and Peebles. She just didn’t know her way around '\n"," 'then. She run herself like she’d never run before. She’s learned plenty '\n"," 'since.” “She has,” said Kelly, “and here’s where she uses it on us. She’s '\n"," 'headed this way.” She was. Straight out across the roughed-out runway she '\n"," 'came, grinding along over the dew-sprinkled earth, 50 Theodore Sturgeon '\n"," 'yesterday’s dust swirling up from under her tracks. Crossing the shoulder '\n"," 'line, she took the rougher ground skillfully, angling up over the occasional '\n"," 'swags in the earth, by-passing stones, riding free and fast and easily. It '\n"," 'was the first time Tom had actually seen her clearly running without an '\n"," 'operator, and his flesh crept as he watched. The machine was unnatural, her '\n"," 'outline somehow unreal and dreamlike purely through the lack of the small '\n"," 'silhouette of a man in the saddle. She looked hulked, compact, dangerous. '\n"," '“What are we gonna do?” wailed A1 Knowles. “We’re gonna sit and wait,” said '\n"," 'Kelly, “and you’re gonna shut your trap. We won’t know for five minutes yet '\n"," 'whether she’s going to go after us from down below or from up here.” “If you '\n"," 'want to leave,” said Tom gently, “go right ahead.” A1 sat down. Kelly looked '\n"," 'ruminatively down at his beloved power shovel, sitting squat and unlovely in '\n"," 'the cut below them and away to their right. “How do you reckon she’d stand '\n"," 'up against the dipper stick?” “If it ever came to a rough-and-tumble,” said '\n"," 'Tom, “I’d say it would be just too bad for Daisy Etta. But she wouldn’t '\n"," 'fight. There’s no way you could get the shovel within pun-chin’ range; '\n"," 'Daisyd just stand there and laugh at you.” “I can’t see her now,” whined Al. '\n"," 'Tom looked. “She’s taken the bluff. She’s going to try it from up here. I '\n"," 'move we sit tight and see if she’s foolish enough to try to walk out here '\n"," 'over that narrow neck. If she does, she’ll drop on her belly with one truck '\n"," 'on each side. Probably turn herself over trying to dig out.” The wait then '\n"," 'was interminable. Back over the hill they could hear the laboring motor; '\n"," 'twice they heard the machine stop momentarily to shift gears. Once they '\n"," 'looked at each other hopefully as the sound rose to a series of bellowing '\n"," 'roars, as if she were backing and filling; then they realized that she was '\n"," 'trying to take some particularly steep part of the bank and having trouble '\n"," 'getting traction. But she made it; the motor revved up as she made the brow '\n"," 'of the hill, and she shifted into fourth gear and came lumbering out into '\n"," 'the open. She lurched up to the edge of the cut, stopped, throttled down, '\n"," 'dropped her blade on the Killdozer 51 ground and stood there idling. A1 '\n"," 'Knowles backed away :o the very edge of the tongue of earth they stood on, '\n"," 'his ;yes practically on stalks. “O.K.—put up or shut up,” Kelly called '\n"," 'across harshly. “She’s looking the situation over,” said- Tom. “That narrow '\n"," 'pathway don’t fool her a bit.” Daisy Etta’s blade began to rise, and stopped '\n"," 'just clear nf the ground. She shifted without clashing her gears, began to '\n"," 'back slowly, still at little more than an idle. “She’s gonna jump!” screamed '\n"," 'Al. “I’m gettin’ out of here!” “Stay here, you fool,” shouted Kelly. “She '\n"," 'can’t get us as long as we’re up here! If you go down, she’ll hunt you down '\n"," 'like a rabbit.” The blast of the Seven’s motor was the last straw for Al. He '\n"," 'squeaked and hopped over the edge, scrambling and sliding down the almost '\n"," 'sheer face of the cut. He hit the bottom running. Daisy Etta lowered her '\n"," 'blade and raised her snout and growled forward, the blade loading. Six, '\n"," 'seven, seven and a half cubic yards of dirt piled up in front of her as she '\n"," 'neared the edge. The loaded blade bit into the narrow pathway that led out '\n"," 'to their perch. It was almost all soft, white, crumbly marl, and the great '\n"," 'machine sank nose down into it, the monstrous overload of topsoil spilling '\n"," 'down on each side. “She’s going to bury herself!” shouted Kelly. “No—wait.” '\n"," 'Tom caught his arm. “She’s trying to turn —she made it! She made it! She’s '\n"," 'ramping herself down to the flat!” “She is—and she’s cut us off from the '\n"," 'bluff!” The bulldozer, blade raised as high as it could possibly go, the '\n"," 'hydraulic rod gleaming clean in the early light, freed herself of the last '\n"," 'of her tremendous load, spun around and headed back upward, sinking her '\n"," 'blade again. She made one more pass between them and the bluff, making a cut '\n"," 'now far two wide for them to jump, particularly to the crumbly footing at '\n"," 'the bluff’s edge. Once down again, she turned to face their haven, now an '\n"," 'isolated pillar of marl, and revved down, waiting. “I never thought of '\n"," 'this,” said Kelly guiltily. “I knew 52 Theodore Sturgeon we’d be safe from '\n"," 'her ramping up, and I never thought she’d try it the other way!” “Skip it. '\n"," 'In the meantime, here we sit. What happens— do we wait up here until she '\n"," 'idles out of fuel, or do we starve to death?” “Oh, this won’t be a siege, '\n"," 'Tom. That thing’s too much of a killer. Where’s Al? I wonder if he’s got '\n"," 'guts enough to make a pass near here with our tractor and draw her off?” “He '\n"," 'had just guts enough to take our tractor and head out,” said Tom. “Didn’t '\n"," 'you know?” “He took our—what?” Kelly looked out toward where they had left '\n"," 'their machine the night before. It was gone. “Why the dirty little yellow '\n"," 'rat!” “No sense cussin’,” said Tom steadily, interrupting what he knew was '\n"," 'the beginning of some really flowery language. “What else could you expect?” '\n"," 'Daisy Etta decided, apparently, how to go about removing their splendid '\n"," 'isolation. She uttered the snort of too-quick. throttle, and moved into '\n"," 'their peak with a corner of her blade, cutting out a huge swipe, '\n"," 'undercutting the material over it so that it fell on her side and track as '\n"," 'she passed. Eight inches disappeared from that side of their little plateau. '\n"," '“Oh-oh. That won’t do a-tall,” said Tom. “Fixin’ to dig us down,” said Kelly '\n"," 'grimly. ‘Take her about twenty minutes. Tom, I say leave.” “It won’t be '\n"," 'healthy. You just got no idea how fast that thing can move now. Don’t '\n"," 'forget, she’s a good deal more tjian she was when she had a man runnin’ her. '\n"," 'She can shift from high to reverse to fifth speed forward like that”—he '\n"," 'snapped his fingers—“and she can pivot faster’n you can blink and throw that '\n"," 'blade just where she wants it.” The tractor passed under them, bellowing, '\n"," 'and their little table was suddenly a foot shorter. “Awright,” said Kelly. '\n"," '“So what do you want to do? Stay here and let her dig the ground out from '\n"," 'under our feet?” “I’m just warning you,” said Tom. “Now listen. We’ll wait '\n"," 'until she’s taking a load. It’ll take her a second to get rid of it when she '\n"," 'knows we’re gone*We’ll split— she Killdozer 53 can’t get both of us. You '\n"," 'head out in the open, try to circle the curve of the bluff and get where you '\n"," 'can climb it. Then come back over here to the cut. A man can scramble off a '\n"," 'fourteen-foot cut faster’n any tractor ever built. I’ll cut in close to the '\n"," 'cut, down at the bottom. If she takes after you, I’ll get clear all right. '\n"," 'If she takes after me, I’ll try to make the shovel and at least give her a '\n"," 'run for her money. I can play hide an’ seek in an’ around and under that '\n"," 'dipper-stick all .day if she wants to play.” “Why me out in the open?” '\n"," '“Don’t you think those long laigs o’ yours can outrun her in that distance?” '\n"," '“Reckon they got to,” grinned Kelly. “O.K., Tom.” They waited tensely. Daisy '\n"," 'Etta backed close by, started another pass. As the motor blatted under the '\n"," 'load, Tom said, “Now!” and they jumped. Kelly, catlike as always, landed on '\n"," 'his feet. Tom, whose knees and ankles were black and blue with rope bruises, '\n"," 'took two staggering steps and fell. Kelly scooped him to his feet as the '\n"," 'dozer’s steel prow came around the bank. Instantly she was in fifth gear and '\n"," 'howling down at them. Kelly flung himself to the left and Tom to the right, '\n"," 'and they pounded away, Kelly out toward the runway, Tom straight for the '\n"," 'shovel. Daisy Etta let them diverge for a moment, keeping her course, trying '\n"," 'to pursue both; then she evidently sized Tom up as the slower, for she swung '\n"," 'toward him. The instant’s hesitation was all Tom needed to get the little '\n"," 'lead necessary. He tore up to the shovel, his legs going like pistons, and '\n"," 'dived down between the shovel’s tracks. As he hit the ground, the big '\n"," 'mangariese-steel moldboard hit the right track of the shovel, and the impact '\n"," 'set all forty-seven tons of the great machine quivering. But Tom did not '\n"," 'stop. He scrabbled his way under the rig, stood up behind it, leaped and '\n"," 'caught the sill of the rear window, clapped his other hand on it, drew '\n"," 'himself up and tumbled inside. Here he was safe for the moment; the huge '\n"," 'tracks themselves were higher than the Seven’s blade could rise, and the '\n"," 'floor of the cab was a good sixteen inches higher than the top of the track. '\n"," 'Tom went to the cab door and peeped outside. The tractor had drawn off and '\n"," 'was idling. “Study away,” gritted Tom, and went to the big Murphy Diesel. He '\n"," 'unhurriedly checked the oil with the bayonet 54 Theodore Sturgeon gauge, '\n"," 'replaced it, took the governor cut-out rod from its rack and inserted it in '\n"," 'the governor casing. He set the master throttle at the halfway mark, pulled '\n"," 'up the starter-handle, twitched the cut-out. The motor spit a wad of blue '\n"," 'smoke out of its hooded exhaust and caught. Tom put the rod back, studied '\n"," 'the fuel-flow glass and pressure gauges, and then went to the door and '\n"," 'looked out again. The Seven had not moved, but it was revving up and down in '\n"," 'that uneven fashion it had shown up on the mesa. Tom had the extraordinary '\n"," 'idea that it was gathering itself to spring. He slipped into the saddle, '\n"," 'threw the master clutch. The big gears that half-filled the cab obediently '\n"," 'began to turn. He kicked the brake-locks loose with his heels, let his feet '\n"," 'rest lightly on the pedals as they rose. Then he reached over his head and '\n"," 'snapped back the throttle. As the Murphy picked up he grasped both hoist and '\n"," 'swing levers and pulled them back. The engine howled;-the two-yard bucket '\n"," 'came up off the ground with a sudden jolt as the cold friction grabbed it. '\n"," 'The big machine swung hard to the right; Tom snapped his hoist lever forward '\n"," 'and checked the bucket’s rise with his foot on the brake. He shoved the '\n"," 'crowd lever forward; the bucket ran out to the end of its reach, and the '\n"," 'heel of the bucket wiped across the Seven’s hood, taking with it the exhaust '\n"," 'stack, muffler and all, and the pre-cleaner on the air intake. Tom cursed. '\n"," 'He had figured on the machine’s leaping backward. If it had, he would have '\n"," 'smashed the cast-iron radiator core. But she had stood still, making a '\n"," 'split-second decision. Now she moved, though, and quickly. With that '\n"," 'incredibly fast shifting, she leaped backwards and pivoted out of range '\n"," 'before Tom could check the shovel’s mad swing. The heayy swing-friction '\n"," 'blocks smoked acridly as the machine slowed, stopped and swung back. Tom '\n"," 'checked her as he was facing the Seven, hoisted his bucket a few feet, and '\n"," 'rehauled, bringing it about halfway back, ready for anything. The four great '\n"," 'dipper-teeth gleamed in the sun. Tom ran a practiced eye over cables, boom '\n"," 'and dipper-stick, liking the black polish of crater compound on the sliding '\n"," 'parts, the easy tension of well-greased cables and links. The huge machine '\n"," 'stood strong, ready and profoundly subservient for all its brute power. Tom '\n"," 'looked searchingly at the Seven’s ruined engine Killdozer 55 hood. The '\n"," 'gaping end of the broken air-intake pipe stared back at him. “Aha!” he said. '\n"," '“A few cupfuls of nice dry marl down there’ll give you something to chew '\n"," 'on.” Keeping a wary eye on the tractor, he swung into the bank, dropped his '\n"," 'bucket and plunged it into the marl. He crowded it deep, and the Murphy '\n"," 'yelled for help but kept on pushing. At the peak of the load a terrific jar '\n"," 'rocked him in the saddle. He looked back over his shoulder through the door '\n"," 'and saw the Seven backing off again. She had run up and delivered a terrific '\n"," 'punch to the counterweight at the back of the cab. Tom grinned tightly. '\n"," 'She’d have to do better than that. There was nothing back there but eight or '\n"," 'ten tons of solid steel. And he didn’t much care at the moment whether or '\n"," 'not she scratched his paint. He swung back again, white marl running away on '\n"," 'both sides of the heaped bucket. The shovel rode perfectly now, for a shovel '\n"," 'is counterweighted to balance true when standing level with the bucket '\n"," 'loaded. The hoist and swing frictions and the brake linings had heated and '\n"," 'dried themselves of the night’s condensation moisture, and she answered the '\n"," 'controls in a way that delighted the operator in him. He handled the swing '\n"," 'lever lightly, back to swing to the right forward to swing to the left, '\n"," 'following the slow dance the Seven had started to do, stepping warily back '\n"," 'and forth like a fighter looking for an opening. Tom kept the bucket between '\n"," 'himself and the tractor, knowing that she could not hurt a tool that was '\n"," 'built to smash hard rock for twenty hours a day and like it. Daisy Etta '\n"," 'bellowed and rushed in. Tom snapped the hoist lever back hard, and the '\n"," 'bucket rose, letting the tractor run underneath. Tom punched the bucket '\n"," 'trip, and the great steel jaw opened, cascading marl down on the broken '\n"," 'hood. The tractor’s fan blew it back in a huge billowing cloud. The instant '\n"," 'that it took Tom to check and dump was enough, however, for the tractor to '\n"," 'dance back out of the way, for when he tried to drop it on the machine to '\n"," 'smash the coiled injector tubes on top of the engine block, she was gone. '\n"," 'The dust cleared away, and the tractor moved in again, feinted to the left, '\n"," 'then swung her blade at the bucket, which was just clear of the ground. Tom '\n"," 'swung to meet her, her feint having gotten her in a little closer than he '\n"," 'liked, and bucket met blade with a shower of sparks and a clank that could '\n"," 'be heard for half a mile. She had come in with her blade high, 56 Theodore '\n"," 'Sturgeon and Tom let out a wordless shout as he saw that the A-frame brace '\n"," 'behind the blade had caught between two of his dipper-teeth. He snatched at '\n"," 'his hoist lever and the bucket came up, lifting with it the whole front end '\n"," 'of the bulldozer. Daisy Etta plunged up and down and her tracks dug '\n"," 'violently into the earth as she raised and lowered her blade, trying to '\n"," 'shake herself free. Tom rehauled, trying to bring the tractor in closer, for '\n"," 'the boom was set too low to attempt to lift such a dead weight. As it was, '\n"," 'the shovel’s off track was trying its best to get off the ground. But the '\n"," 'crowd and rehaul frictions could not handle her alone; they began to heat '\n"," 'and slip. Tom hoisted a little; the shovel’s off track came up a foot off '\n"," 'the ground. Tom cursed and let the bucket drop, and in an instant the dozer '\n"," 'was free and running clear. Tom swung wildly at her, missed. The dozer came '\n"," 'in on a long curve; Tom swung to meet her again, took a vicious swipe at her '\n"," 'which she took on her blade. But this time she did not withdraw after being '\n"," 'hit, but bored right in, carrying the bucket before her. Before Tom realized '\n"," 'what she was doing, his bucket was around in front of the tracks and between '\n"," 'them, on the ground. It was as swift and skillful a maneuver as could be '\n"," 'imagined, and it left the shovel without the ability to swing as long as '\n"," 'Daisy Etta could hold the bucket trapped between the tracks. Tom crowded '\n"," 'furiously, but that succeeded only in lifting the boom higher in the air, '\n"," 'since there is nothing to hold a boom down but its own weight. Hoisting did '\n"," 'nothing but make his frictions smoke and rev the engine down dangerously '\n"," 'close to the stalling point. Tom swore again and reached down to the cluster '\n"," 'of small levers at his left. These were the gears. On this type of shovel, '\n"," 'the swing lever controls everything except crowd and hoist. With the swing '\n"," 'lever, the operator, having selected his gear, controls the travel—that is, '\n"," 'power to the tracks—in forward and reverse; booming up and booming down; and '\n"," 'swinging. The machine can do only one of these things at a time. If she is '\n"," 'in travel gear, she cannot swing. If she is in swing gear, she cannot boom '\n"," 'up or down. Not once in years of operating would this inability bother an '\n"," 'operator; now, however, nothing was normal. Tom pushed the swing gear '\n"," 'control down and pulled up Killdozer 57 on the travel. The clutches involved '\n"," 'were jaw clutches, not frictions, so that he had to throttle down to an idle '\n"," 'before he could make the castellations mesh. As the Murphy revved down, '\n"," 'Daisy Etta took it as a signal that something could be done about it, and '\n"," 'she shoved furiously into the bucket. But Tom had all controls in neutral '\n"," 'and all she succeeded in doing was to dig herself in, her sharp new cleats '\n"," 'spinning deep into the dirt. Tom set his throttle up again and shoved the '\n"," 'swing lever forward. There was a vast crackling of drive chains; and the big '\n"," 'tracks started to turn. Daisy Etta had sharp cleats; her pads were twenty '\n"," 'inches wide and her tracks were fourteen feet long, and there were fourteen '\n"," 'tons of steel on them. The shovel’s big flat pads were three feet wide and '\n"," 'twenty feet long, and forty-seven tons aboard. There was simply no '\n"," 'comparison. The Murphy bellowed the fact that the work was hard, but gave no '\n"," 'indications of stalling. Daisy Etta performed the incredible feat of '\n"," 'shifting into a forward gear while she was moving backwards, but it did her '\n"," 'no good. Round and round her tracks went, trying to drive her forward, '\n"," 'gouging deep; and slowly and surely she was forced backward toward the cut '\n"," 'wall by the shovel. Tom heard a sound that was not part of a straining '\n"," 'machine; he looked out and saw Kelly up on top of the cut, smoking, swinging '\n"," 'his feet over the edge, making punching motions with his hands as if he had '\n"," 'a ringside seat at a big fight—which he certainly had. Tom now offered the '\n"," 'dozer little choice. If she did not turn aside before him, she would be '\n"," 'borne back against the bank and her fuel tank,crushed. There was every '\n"," 'possibility that, having her pinned there, Tom would have time to raise his '\n"," 'bucket over her and smash her to pieces. And if she turned before \"She was '\n"," 'forced against the bank, she would have to free Tom’s bucket. This she had '\n"," 'to do. The Murphy gave him warning, but not enough. It crooned as the load '\n"," 'came off, and Tom knew then that the dozer was shifting into a reverse gear. '\n"," 'He whipped the hoist lever back, and the bucket rose as the dozer backed '\n"," 'away from him. He crowded it out and let it come smashing down—and missed. '\n"," 'For the tractor danced aside—and while he was in travel gear he could not '\n"," 'swing to follow it. Daisy Etta charged then, put one track on the bank and '\n"," 'went over almost on her beam- 58 Theodore Sturgeon ends, throwing one end of '\n"," 'her blade high in the air. So totally unexpected was it that Tom was quite '\n"," 'unprepared. The tractor flung itself on the bucket, and the cutting edge of '\n"," 'the blade dropped between the dipper teeth. This time there was the whole '\n"," 'weight of the tractor to hold it there. There would be no way for her to '\n"," 'free herself—but at the same time she had trapped the bucket so far out from '\n"," 'the center pin of the shovel that Tom couldn’t hoist without overbalancing '\n"," 'and turning the monster over. Daisy Etta ground away in reverse, dragging '\n"," 'the bucket out until it was checked by the bumper-blocks. Then she began to '\n"," 'crab sideways, up against the bank and when Tom tried tentatively to rehaul, '\n"," 'she shifted and came right with him, burying one whole end of her blade deep '\n"," 'into the bank. Stalemate. She had hung herself up on the bucket, and she had '\n"," 'immobilized it. Tom tried to rehaul, but the tractor’s anchorage in the bank '\n"," 'was too solid. He tried to swing, to hoist. All the over worked frictions '\n"," 'could possibly give out was smoke. Tom grunted and throttled to an idle, '\n"," 'leaned out the window. Daisy Etta was idling too, loudly without her '\n"," 'muffler, the stackless exhaust giving out an ugly flat sound. But after the '\n"," 'roar of the two great motors the partial silence was deafening. Kelly called '\n"," 'down, “Double knockout, hey?” “Looks like it. What say we see if we can’t '\n"," 'get close enough to her to quiet her down some?” Kelly shrugged. “I dunno. '\n"," 'If she’s really stopped herself, it’s the first time. I respect that rig, '\n"," 'Tom. She wouldn’t have got herself into that spot if she didn’t have an ace '\n"," 'up her sleeve.” \" “Look at her, man! Suppose she was a civilized bulldozer '\n"," 'and you had to get her out of there. She can’t raise her blade high enough '\n"," 'to free it from those dipper-teeth, y’know. Think you’d be able to do it?” '\n"," '“It might take several seconds,” Kelly drawled. “She’s sure high and dry.” '\n"," '“O.K., let’s spike her guns.” 1 “Like what?” “Like taking a bar and prying '\n"," 'out her tubing.” He referred to the coiled brass tubing that carried the '\n"," 'fuel, under pressure, from the pump to the injectors. There were many feet '\n"," 'of it, Killdozer 59 running from the pump reservoir, stacked in expansion '\n"," 'coils over the cylinder head. As he spoke Daisy Ettas idle burst into that '\n"," 'maniac revving up and down characteristic of her. “What do you know!” Tom '\n"," 'called above the racket. “Eavesdropping!” Kelly slid down the cut, stood up '\n"," 'on the track of the shovel and poked his head in the window. “Well, you want '\n"," 'to get a bar and try?” “Let’s go!” Tom went to the toolbox and pulled out '\n"," 'the pinch bar that Kelly used to replace cables on his machine, and swung to '\n"," 'the ground. They approached the tractor warily. She revved up as they came '\n"," 'near, began to shudder. The front end rose and dropped and the tracks began '\n"," 'to turn as she tried to twist out of the vise her blade had dropped into. '\n"," '“Take it easy, sister,” said Tom. “You’ll just bury yourself. Set still and '\n"," 'take it, now, like a good girl. You got it cornin’.” “Be careful,” said '\n"," 'Kelly. Tom hefted the bar and laid a hand on the fender. The tractor '\n"," 'literally shivered, and from the rubber hose connection at the top of the '\n"," 'radiator, a blinding stream of hot water shot out. It fanned and caught them '\n"," 'both full in the face. They staggered back, cursing. “You O.K., Tom?” Kelly '\n"," 'gasped a moment later. He had got most of it across the mouth and cheek. Tom '\n"," 'was on his knees, his shirt tail out, blotting at his face. “My eyes ... oh, '\n"," 'my eyes—” “Let’s see!” Kelly dropped down beside him and took him by the '\n"," 'wrists, gently removing Tom’s hands from his face. He whistled. “Come '\n"," 'on,”Jie gritted. He helped Tom up and led him away a few feet. “Stay here,” '\n"," 'he said hoarsely. He turned, walked back toward the dozer, picking up the '\n"," 'pinchbar. “You dirty-----!” he yelled, and flung it like a javelin at the '\n"," 'tube coils. It was a little high. It struck the ruined hood, made a deep '\n"," 'dent in the metal. The dent promptly inverted with a loud thung-g-g! and '\n"," 'flung the bar back at him. He ducked; it whistled over his head and caught '\n"," 'Tom in the calves of his legs. He went down like a poled ox, but staggered '\n"," 'to his feet again. “Come on!” Kelly snarled, and taking Tom’s arm, hustled '\n"," 'him around the turn of the cut. “Sit down! I’ll be right back.” 60 Theodore '\n"," 'Sturgeon “Where you going? Kelly—be careful!” “Careful and how!” Kelly’s '\n"," 'long legs ate up the distance back to the shovel. He swung into the cab, '\n"," 'reached back over the motor and set up the master throttle all the way. '\n"," 'Stepping up behind the saddle, he opened the running throttle and the Murphy '\n"," 'howled. Then he hauled back on the hoist lever until it knuckled in, turned '\n"," 'and leaped off the machine in one supple motion. The hoist drum turned and '\n"," 'took up slack; the cable straightened as it took the strain. The bucket '\n"," 'stirred under the dead weight of the bulldozer that rested on it; and '\n"," 'slowly, then, the great flat tracks began to lift their rear ends off the '\n"," 'ground. The great obedient mass of machinery teetered forward on the tips of '\n"," 'her tracks, the Murphy revved down and under the incredible load, but it '\n"," 'kept the strain. A strand of the two-part hoist cable broke and whipped '\n"," 'around,, singing; and then she was balanced—over-balanced— And the shovel '\n"," 'had hauled herself right over and had fallen with an earth-shaking crash. '\n"," 'The boom, eight tons of solid steel, clanged down onto the blade of the '\n"," 'bulldozer, and lay there, crushing it down tightly onto the imprisoning row '\n"," 'of dipper-teeth. Daisy Etta sat there, not trying to move now, racing her '\n"," 'motor impotently. Kelly strutted past her, thumbing his nose, and went back '\n"," 'to Tom. “Kelly! I thought you were never coming back! What happened?” '\n"," '“Shovel pulled herself over on her nose.” \\\\ “Good boy! Fall on the '\n"," 'tractor?” “Nup. But the boom’s laying across the top of her blade. Caught '\n"," 'like a rat in a trap.” “Better watch out the rat don’t chew its leg off to '\n"," 'get out,” said Tom, drily. “Still runnin’, is she?” “Yep. But we’ll fix that '\n"," 'in a hurry.” “Sure. Sure. How?” “How? I dunno. Dynamite, maybe. How’s the '\n"," 'optics?” Tom opened one a trifle and grunted. “Rough. I can see a little, '\n"," 'though. My eyelids are parboiled, mostly. Dynamite, you say? Well, let’s '\n"," 'think first. Think.” Tom sat back against the bank and stretched out his '\n"," 'legs. “I tell you, Kelly, I been too blessed busy these last few hours to '\n"," 'think much, but there’s one thing that keeps cornin’ back Killdozer 61 to '\n"," 'me—somethin’ I was mullin’ over long before the rest of you guys knew '\n"," 'anything was up at all, except that Rivera had got hurt in some way I '\n"," '\"wouldn’t tell you all about. But I don’t reckon you’ll call me crazy if 1 '\n"," 'open my mouth now and let it all run out?” “From now on,” Kelly said '\n"," 'fervently, “nobody’s crazy. After this I’ll believe anything.” He sat down. '\n"," '“O.K. Well, about that tractor. What do you suppose has got into her?” '\n"," '“Search me. I dunno.” “No—don’t say that. I just got an idea we can’t stop '\n"," 'at ‘I dunno.’ We got to figure all the angles on this thing before we know '\n"," 'just what to do about it. Let’s just get this thing lined upr— ■When did it '\n"," 'start? On the mesa. How? Rivera was opening an old building with the Seven. '\n"," 'This thing came out of there. Now here’s what I’m getting at. We can dope '\n"," 'these things out about it: It’s intelligent. It can only get into a machine '\n"," 'and not into a man. It—” “What about that? How do you know it can’t?” '\n"," '“Because it had the chance to and didn’t. I was standing right by the '\n"," 'opening when it kited out. Rivera was up on the machine at the time. It '\n"," 'didn’t directly harm either of us. It got into the tractor, and the tractor '\n"," 'did. By the same token, it can’t hurt a man when it’s out of a machine, but '\n"," 'that’s all it wants to do when it’s in one. O.K.? “To get on: once it’s in '\n"," 'one machine it can’t get out again. We know that because it had plenty of '\n"," 'chances and didn’t take them. That scuffle with the dipper-stick, f’r '\n"," 'instance. My face woulda been plenty red if it had taken over the shovel— '\n"," 'and you can bet it would have if it could.” “I got you so far. But what are '\n"," 'we going to dp about it?” “That’s the thing. You see, I don’t think it’s '\n"," 'enough to wreck the tractor. We might burn it, blast it, and still not hurt '\n"," 'whatever it was that got into it up on the mesa.” “That makes sense. But I '\n"," 'don’t see what else we can do than just break up the dozer. We haven’t got a '\n"," 'line on actually what the thing is.” “I think we have. Remember I asked you '\n"," 'all those screwy questions about the arc that killed Peebles. Well, when '\n"," 'that happened, I recollected a flock of other things. One—when it got out of '\n"," 'that hole up there, I smelled that smell that you 62 Theodore Sturgeon '\n"," 'notice when you’re welding; sometimes when lightning strikes real close.” '\n"," '“Ozone,” said Kelly. “Yeah—ozone. Then, it likes metal, not flesh. But most '\n"," 'of all, there was that arc. Now, that was absolutely screwy. You know as '\n"," 'well as I do—better—that an arc generator simply don’t have the push to do a '\n"," 'thing like that. It can’t kill a man, and it can’t throw an arc no fifty '\n"," 'feet. But it did. An’ that’s why I asked you if there could be something—a '\n"," 'field, or some such—that could suck current out of a generator, all at once, '\n"," 'faster than it could flow. Because this thing’s electrical; it fits all '\n"," 'around.” “Electronic,” said Kelly doubtfully, thoughtfully. “I wouldn’t '\n"," 'know. Now then. When Peebles was killed, a funny thing happened. Remember '\n"," 'what Chub said? The Seven moved back—straight back, about thirty feet, until '\n"," 'it bumped into a roadroller that was standing behind it. It did that with no '\n"," 'fuel in the starting engine—without even using the starting engine, for that '\n"," 'matter—and with the compression valves locked open! “Kelly, that thing in '\n"," 'the dozer can’t do much, when you come right down to it. It couldn’t fix '\n"," 'itself up after that joyride on the mesa. It can’t make the machine do too '\n"," 'much more than the machine can do ordinarily. What it actually can do, seems '\n"," 'to me, is to make a spring push instead of pull, like the control levers, '\n"," 'and make a fitting slip when it’s supposed to hold, like the ratchet on the '\n"," 'throttle lever. It can turn a shaft, like the way it cranks its own starting '\n"," 'motor. But if it was so all-fired high-powered, it wouldn’t have to use the '\n"," 'starting motor! The absolute biggest job it’s done so far, seems to me, was '\n"," 'when it walked back from that welding machine when Peebles got his. Now, why '\n"," 'did it do that just then?” “Reckon it didn’t like the brimstone smell, like '\n"," 'it says in the Good Book,” said Kelly sourly. “That’s pretty close, seems to '\n"," 'me. Look, Kelly—this thing feels things. I mean, it can get sore. If it '\n"," 'couldn’t it never woulda kept driving in at the shovel like that. It can '\n"," 'think. But if it can do all those things, then it can be scared!” “Scared? '\n"," 'Why should it be scared?” “Listen. Something went on in that thing when the '\n"," 'arc hit it. What’s that I read in a magazine once about heat—some- Killdozer '\n"," '63 thing about molecules runnin’ around with their heads cut off when they '\n"," 'got hot?” “Molecules do. They go into rapid motion when heat is applied. '\n"," 'But—” “But nothin’. That machine was hot for four hours after that. But she '\n"," 'was hot in a funny way. Not just around the place where the arc hit, like as '\n"," 'if it was a welding arc. But hot all over—from the moldboard to the '\n"," 'fuel-tank cap. Hot everywhere. And just as hot behind the final drive '\n"," 'housings as she was at the top of the blade where the poor guy put his hand. '\n"," '“And look at this.” Tom was getting excited, as his words crystallized his '\n"," 'ideas. “She was scared—scared enough to back off from that welder, putting '\n"," 'everything she could into it, to get back from that welding machine. And '\n"," 'after that, she was sick. I say that because in the whole time she’s had '\n"," 'that what-ever-ya-call-it in her, she’s never been near men without trying '\n"," 'to kill them, except for those two days after the arc hit her. She had juice '\n"," 'enough to start herself when Dennis came • around with the crank, but she '\n"," 'still needed someone to run her till she got her strength back.” v “But why '\n"," 'didn’t she turn and smash up the welder when Dennis took her?” “One of two '\n"," 'things. She didn’t have the strength, or she didn’t have the guts. She was '\n"," 'scared, maybe, and wanted out of there, away from that thing.” “But she had '\n"," 'all night to go back for it!” “Still scared. Or . . . oh, that’s it! She had '\n"," 'other things to do first. Her main idea is to kill men—there’s no other way '\n"," 'you can figure it. It’s what she was built to do. Not the tractor— they '\n"," 'don’t build ’em sweeter’n that machine; but the thing that’s runnin’ it.” '\n"," '“What is that thing?” Kelly mused. “Coming out of that old '\n"," 'building—temple—what have you—how old is it? How long was it there? What '\n"," 'kept it in there?” “What kept it in there was some funny gray stuff that '\n"," 'lined the inside of the buildin’,” said Tom. “It was like rock, an’ it was '\n"," 'like ^moke. “It was a color that scared you to look at it, and it gave '\n"," 'Rivera and me the creeps when we got near it. Don’t ask me what it was. I '\n"," 'went up there to look at it, and it’s gone. Gone from the building, anyhow. '\n"," 'There was a little lump of it on 64 Theodore Sturgeon the ground. I don’t '\n"," 'know whether that was a hunk of it, or all of it rolled up into a ball. I '\n"," 'get the creeps again thinkin’ about it.” Kelly stood up. “Well, the heck '\n"," 'with it. We been beatin’ our gums up here too long anyhow. There’s just '\n"," 'enough sense in what you say to make me want to try something nonsensical, '\n"," 'if you see what I mean. If that welder can sweat the Ol’ Nick out of that '\n"," 'tractor, I’m on. Especially from fifty feet away. There should be a Dumptor '\n"," 'around here somewhere; let’s move from here. Can you navigate now?” “Reckon '\n"," 'so, a little.” Tom rose and together they followed the cut until they came '\n"," 'on the Dumptor. They climbed on, cranked it up and headed toward camp. About '\n"," 'half way there Kelly looked back, gasped, and putting his mouth close to '\n"," 'Tom’s ear, bellowed against the scream of the motor, “Tom! ’Member what you '\n"," 'said about the rat in the trap biting off a leg?” “Well, Daisy did too! '\n"," 'She’s left her blade an’ pushbeams an’ she’s followin’ us in!” They howled '\n"," 'into the camp, gasping against the dust that followed when they pulled up by '\n"," 'the welder. Kelly said, “You cast around and see if you can find a drawpin '\n"," 'to hook that rig up to the Dumptor with. I’m goin’ after some water an’ '\n"," 'chow!” Tom grinned. Imagine old Kelly forgetting that a Dumptor had no '\n"," 'drawbar! He groped around to a toolbox, peering out of the narrow slit '\n"," 'beneath swollen lids, felt behind it and located a shackle. He climbed up on '\n"," 'the Dumptor, turned it around and backed up to the welding machine. He '\n"," 'passed the shackle through the ring at the end of the steering tongue of the '\n"," 'welder, screwed in the pin and dropped the shackle over the front towing '\n"," 'hook of the Dumptor. A Dumptor being what it is, having no real front and no '\n"," 'real rear, and direct reversing gears in all speeds, it was no trouble to '\n"," 'drive it “backwards” for a change. Kelly came pounding back, out of breath. '\n"," '“Fix it? Good. Shackle? No drawbar! Daisy’s closin’ up fast; I say let’s '\n"," 'take the beach. We’ll be concealed until we have a good lead out o’ this '\n"," 'pocket, and the going’s pretty fair, long as we don’t bury this jalopy in '\n"," 'the sand.” “Good,” said Tom as they climbed on and he accepted an Killdozer '\n"," '65 open tin of K. “Only go easy; bump around too much and the welder’ll slip '\n"," 'off the hook. An’ I somehow don’t want to lose it just now.” They took off, '\n"," 'zooming up the beach. A quarter of a mile up, they sighted the Seven across '\n"," 'the flat. It immediately turned and took a course that would intercept them. '\n"," '“Here she comes,” shouted Kelly, and stepped down hard on the accelerator. '\n"," 'Tom leaned over the back of the seat, keeping his eye on their tow. “Hey! '\n"," 'Take it easy! Watch it! “Hey!” But it was too late. The tongue of the '\n"," 'welding machine responded to that one bump too many. The shackle jumped up '\n"," 'off the hook, the welder lurched wildly, slewed hard to the left. The tongue '\n"," 'dropped to the sand and dug in; the machine rolled up on it and snapped it '\n"," 'off, finally stopped, leaning crazily askew. By a miracle it did not quite '\n"," 'turn over. Kelly tramped on the brakes and both their heads did their utmost '\n"," 'to snap off their shoulders. They leaped off and ran back to the welder. It '\n"," 'was intact, but towing it was now out of the question. “If there’s going to '\n"," 'be a showdown, it’s gotta be here.” The beach here was about thirty yards '\n"," 'wide, the sand almost level, and undercut banks of sawgrass forming the '\n"," 'landward edge in a series of little hummocks and headlands. While Tom stayed '\n"," 'with the machine, testing starter and generator contacts, Kelly walked up '\n"," 'one of the little mounds, stood up on it and scanned the beach back the way '\n"," 'he had come. Suddenly he began to shout and wave his arms. “What’s got into '\n"," 'you?” “It’s Al!” Kelly called back. “With the pan tractor!” Tom dropped what '\n"," 'he was doing, and came to stand beside Kelly. “Where’s the Seven? I can’t '\n"," 'see.” “Turned on the beach and followin’ our track. Al! Al! You little '\n"," 'skunk, c’mere!” Tom could now dimly make out the pan tractor cutting across '\n"," 'directly toward them and the beach. “He don’t see Daisy Etta,” remarked '\n"," 'Kelly disgustedly, “or he’d sure be headin’ the other way.” / Fifty yards '\n"," 'away Al pulled up and throttled down. Kelly shouted and waved to him. Al '\n"," 'stood *up on the machine, cupped his hands around his mouth. “Where’s the '\n"," 'Seven?” “Never mind that! Come here with that tractor!” 66 Theodore Sturgeon '\n"," 'A1 stayed where he was. Kelly cursed and started out after him. “You stay '\n"," 'away from me,” he said when Kelly was closer. “I ain’t got time for you '\n"," 'now,” said Kelly. “Bring that tractor down to the beach.” “Where’s that '\n"," 'Daisy Etta?” Al’s voice was oddly strained. “Right behind us.” Kelly tossed '\n"," 'a thumb over his shoulder. “On the beach.” Al’s pop eyes clicked wide almost '\n"," 'audibly. He turned on his heel and jumped off the machine and started to '\n"," 'run. Kelly uttered a wordless syllable that was somehow more obscene than '\n"," 'anything else he had ever uttered, and vaulted into the seat of the machine. '\n"," '“Hey!” he bellowed after Al’s rapidly diminishing figure. “You’re runnin’ '\n"," 'right into her.” A1 appeared not to hear, but went pelting down the beach. '\n"," 'Kelly put her into fifth gear and poured on the throttle. As the tractor '\n"," 'began to move he whacked out the master clutch, snatched the overdrive lever '\n"," 'back to put her into sixth, rammed the clutch in again, all so fast that she '\n"," 'did not have time to stop rolling. Bucking and jumping over the rough ground '\n"," 'the fast machine whined for the beach. Tom was fumbling back to the welder, '\n"," 'his ears telling him better than his eyes how close the Seven was—for she '\n"," 'was certainly no nightingale, particularly without her exhaust stack. Kelly '\n"," 'reached the machine as he did. “Get behind it,” snapped Tom. “I’ll jamb the '\n"," 'tierod with the shackle, and you see if you can’t bunt her up into that '\n"," 'pocket between those two hummocks. Only take it easy—you don’t want to tear '\n"," 'up that generator. Where’s Al?” “Don’t ask me. He run down the beach to meet '\n"," 'Daisy” “He what?” The whine of the two-cycle drowned out Kelly’s answer, if '\n"," 'any. He got behind the welder and set his blade against it. Then in a low '\n"," 'gear, slipping his clutch in a little, he slowly nudged the machine toward '\n"," 'the place Tom had indicated. It was a little hollow in between two '\n"," 'projecting banks. The surf and the high-tide mark dipped inland here to '\n"," 'match it; the water was only a few feet away. Tom raised his arm and Kelly '\n"," 'stopped. From the other side of the projecting shelf, out of their sight '\n"," 'now, came the flat roar of the Seven’s exhaust. Kelly sprang off the tractor '\n"," 'and went to help Tom, who was furiously throwing out coils of Killdozer 67 '\n"," 'cable from the rack back of the welder. “What’s the game?” “We got to ground '\n"," 'that Seven some way,” panted Tom. He threw the last bit of cable out to '\n"," 'clear it of kinks and turned to the panel. “How was it—about sixty volts and '\n"," 'the amperage on ‘special application’?” He spun the dials, pressed the '\n"," '(starter button. The motor responded instantly. Kelly scooped up ground '\n"," 'clamp and rod holder and tapped them together. The solenoid governor picked '\n"," 'up the load and the motor hummed as a good live spark took the jump. “Good,” '\n"," 'said Tom, switching off the generator. “Come on, Lieutenant General '\n"," 'Electric, figure me out a way to ground that maverick.” Kelly tightened his '\n"," 'lips, shook his head. “I dunno—unless somebody actually clamps this thing on '\n"," 'her.” “No, boy, can’t do that. If one of us gets killed—” Kelly tossed the '\n"," 'ground clamp idly, his lithe body taut. “Don’t give me that, Tom. You know '\n"," 'I’m elected because you can’t see good enough yet to handle it. You know '\n"," 'you’d do it if you could. You—” He stopped short, for the steadily '\n"," 'increasing roar of the approaching Seven had stopped, was blatting away now '\n"," 'in that extraordinary irregular throttling that Daisy Etta affected. “Now, '\n"," 'what’s got into her?” Kelly broke away and scrambled up the bank. “Tom!” he '\n"," 'gasped. “Tom—come up here!” Tom followed, and they lay side by side, peering '\n"," 'out over the top of the escarpment at the remarkable tableau. Daisy Etta was '\n"," 'standing on the beach, near the water, not moving. Before her, twenty or '\n"," 'thirty feet away, stood A1 Knowles, his arms out in front of him, talking a '\n"," 'blue streak. Daisy made far too much racket for them to hear what he was '\n"," 'saying. “Do you reckon he’s got guts enough to stall her off for us?” said '\n"," 'Tom. “If he has, it’s the queerest thing that’s happened yet on this old '\n"," 'island,” Kelly breathed, “an’ that’s saying something.” The Seven revved up '\n"," 'till she shook, and then throttled back. She ran down so low then that they '\n"," 'thought, she had shut herself down, but she caught on the last two '\n"," 'revolutions and began to idle quietly. And then they could hear. Al’s voice '\n"," 'was high, hysterical. “—I come t’ he’p you, I 68 Theodore Sturgeon come t’ '\n"," 'he’p you, don’ kill me, I’ll he’p you—” He took a step forward; the dozer '\n"," 'snorted and he fell to his knees. “I’ll wash you an’ grease you and change '\n"," 'yo’ ile,” he said in a high singsong. “The guy’s not human,” said Kelly '\n"," 'wonderingly. “He ain’t housebroke either,” Tom chuckled. “—lemme he’p you. '\n"," 'I’ll fix you when you break down. I’ll he’p you kill those other guys—” “She '\n"," 'don’t need any help!” said Tom. “The louse,” growled Kelly. “The rotten '\n"," 'little double-crossing polecat!” He stood up. “Hey, you Al! Come out o’ '\n"," 'that. I mean now! If she don’t get you I will, if you don’t move.” Al was '\n"," 'crying now. “Shut up!” he screamed. “I know who’s bawss hereabouts, an’ so '\n"," 'do you!” He pointed at the tractor. “She’ll kill us all off’n we don’t do '\n"," 'what she wants!” He turned back to the machine. “I’ll k-kill ’em fo’ you. '\n"," 'I’ll wash you and shine you up and f-fix yo’ hood. I’ll put yo’ blade back '\n"," 'on. . . Tom reached out and caught Kelly’s leg as the tall man started out, '\n"," 'blind mad. “Git back here,” he barked. “What you want to do—get killed for '\n"," 'the privilege of pinnin’ his ears back?” Kelly subsided and came back, threw '\n"," 'himself down beside Tom, put his face in his hands. He was quivering with '\n"," 'rage. “Don’t take on so,” Tom said. ‘The man’s plumb loco. You can’t argue '\n"," 'with him any more’n you can with Daisy, there. If he’s got to get his, '\n"," 'Daisyll give itrto him.” “Aw, Tom, it ain’t that. I know.he ain’t worth it, '\n"," 'but I can’t sit up here and watch him get himself killed. I can’t, Tom.” Tom '\n"," 'thumped him on the shoulder, because there were simply no words to be said. '\n"," 'Suddenly he stiffened, snapped his fingers. “There’s our ground,” he said '\n"," 'urgently, pointing seaward. “The water—the wet beach where the surf runs. If '\n"," 'we can get our ground clamp out there and her somewhere near it—” “Ground '\n"," 'the pan tractor. Run it out into the water. It ought to reach—partway, '\n"," 'anyhow.” “That’s it—c’mon.” They slid down the bank, snatched up the ground '\n"," 'clamp, attached it to the frame of the pan tractor. “I’ll take it,” said '\n"," 'Tom, and as Kelly opened his mouth, Killdozer 69 Tom shoved him back against '\n"," 'the welding machine. “No time to argue,” he snapped, swung on to the '\n"," 'machine, slapped her in gear and was off. Kelly took a step toward the '\n"," 'tractor, and then his quick eyes saw a bight of the ground cable about to '\n"," 'foul a wheel of the welder. He stooped and threw it off, spread out the rest '\n"," 'of it so it would pay off clear. Tom, with the incredible single-mindedness '\n"," 'of the trained operator, watched only the black line of the trailing cable '\n"," 'on the sand behind him. When it straightened, he stopped. The front of the '\n"," 'tracks were sloshing in the gentle surf. He climbed off the side away from '\n"," 'the Seven and tried to see. There was movement, and the growl of her motor '\n"," 'now running at a bit more than idle, but he could not distinguish much. '\n"," 'Kelly picked up the rod-holder and went to peer around the head of the '\n"," 'protruding bank. A1 was on his feet, still crooning hysterically, sidling '\n"," 'over toward Daisy Etta. Kelly ducked back, threw the switch on the arc '\n"," 'generator, climbed the bank and crawled along through the sawgrass '\n"," 'paralleling the beach until the holder in his hand tugged and he knew he had '\n"," 'reached the end of the cable. He looked out at the beach; measured carefully '\n"," 'with his eye the arc he would travel if he left his position and, keeping '\n"," 'the cable taut, went out on the beach. At no point would he come within '\n"," 'seventy feet of the possessed machine, let alone fifty. She had to be. drawn '\n"," 'in closer. And she had to be maneuvered out to the wet sand, or in the '\n"," 'water— A1 Knowles, encouraged by the machine’s apparent decision not to '\n"," 'move, approached, though warily, and still running off at the mouth. “—we’ll '\n"," 'kill ’em off an’ then we’ll keep it a secret and th’ bahges’ll come an’ take '\n"," 'us offen th’ island and we’ll go to anothah job an’ kill us lots mo’ ... an’ '\n"," 'when yo’ tracks git dry an’ squeak we’ll wet ’em with blood, and you’ll be '\n"," 'rightly king o’ the hill . . . look yondah, look yon-dah, Daisy Etta, see '\n"," 'them theah, by the otheh tractuh, theah they are, kill ’em, Daisy, kill ’em, '\n"," 'Daisy, an’ lemme he’p . . . heah me. Daisy, heah me, say you heah me—” and '\n"," 'the motor roared in response. A1 laid a timid hand on the radiator guard, '\n"," 'leaning far over to do it, and the tractor still stood there grumbling but '\n"," 'not moving. A1 stepped back, motioned with his arm, began to walk off slowly '\n"," 'toward the pan tractor, looking backwards as he did so like a man training a '\n"," 'dog. 70 Theodore Sturgeon “C’mon, c’mon, theah’s one theah, le’s kill’m, '\n"," 'kilYm, killm. . . .” And with a snort the tractor revved up and followed. '\n"," 'Kelly licked his lips without effect because his tongue was dry, too. The '\n"," 'madman passed him, walking straight up the center of the beach, and the '\n"," 'tractor, now no longer a bulldozer, followed him; and there the sand was '\n"," 'bone dry, sun-dried, dried to powder. As the tractor passed him, Kelly got '\n"," 'up on all fours, went over the edge of the bank onto the beach, crouched '\n"," 'there. A1 crooned, “I love ya, honey, I love ya, ’deed I do—” Kelly ran '\n"," 'crouching, like a man under machine-gun fire, making himself as small as '\n"," 'possible and feeling as big as a barn door. The torn-up sand where the '\n"," 'tractor had passed was under his feet now; he stopped, afraid to get too '\n"," 'much closer, afraid that a weakened, badly grounded arc might leap from the '\n"," 'holder in his hand and serve only to alarm and infuriate the thing in the '\n"," 'tractor. And just then A1 saw him. “There!” he screamed; and the tractor '\n"," 'pulled up short “Behind you! Get’m, Daisy! KilYm kilYm, killm.” Kelly stood '\n"," 'up almost -wearily, fury and frustration too much to be borne. “In the '\n"," 'water,” he yelled, because it was what his-whole being wanted “Get’er in the '\n"," 'water! Wet her tracks, Al!” “KilYm, kill’m—” As the tractor started to turn, '\n"," 'there was a commotion over by the pan tractor. It was Tom, jumping, '\n"," 'shouting, waving his arms, swearing. He ran out from behind his machine, '\n"," 'straight at the Seven. Daisy Etta’s motor roared and she swung to meet him. '\n"," 'Al barely dancing back out of the way. Tom cut sharply, sand spouting under '\n"," 'his pumping feet, and ran straight into the water. He went out to about '\n"," 'waist deep, suddenly disappeared. He surfaced, spluttering, still trying to '\n"," 'shout. Kelly took a better grip on his rod holder and rushed. Daisy Etta, in '\n"," 'following Tom’s crazy rush, had swung in beside the pan tractor, not fifteen '\n"," 'feet away;and she, too, was now in the surf. Kelly closed up the distance as '\n"," 'fast as his long legs would let him; and as he approached to within that '\n"," 'crucial fifty feet, Al Knowles hit him. Al was frothing at the mouth, '\n"," 'gibbering. The two men hit full tilt; Al’s head caught Kelly in the midriff '\n"," 'as he missed a Kiixdozer 71 straightarm, and the breath went out of him in '\n"," 'one great whoosh\\\\ Kelly went down like tall timber, the whole world turned '\n"," 'to one swirling red-gray haze. A1 flung himself on the bigger man, clawing, '\n"," 'smacking, too berserk to ball his fists. “Ah’m go’ to kill you,” he gurgled. '\n"," '“She’ll git one, I’ll git t’other, an’ then she’ll know—” Kelly covered his '\n"," 'face with his arms, and as some wind was sucked at last into his laboring '\n"," 'lungs, he flung them upward and sat up in one mighty surge. A1 was hurled '\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":[" 'upward and to one side, and as he hit the ground Kelly reached out a long '\n"," 'arm, and twisted his fingers into the man’s coarse hair, raised him up, and '\n"," 'came across with his other fist in a punch that would have killed him had it '\n"," 'landed square. But A1 managed to jerk to one side enough so that it only '\n"," 'amputated a cheek. He fell and lay still. Kelly scrambled madly around in '\n"," 'the sand for his welding-rod holder, found it and began to run again. He '\n"," 'couldn’t see Tom at all now, and the Seven was standing in the surf, moving '\n"," 'slowly from side to side, backing out, ravening. Kelly held the rod-clamp '\n"," 'and its trailing cable blindly before him and ran straight at the machine. '\n"," 'And then it came —that thin, soundless bolt of energy. But this time it had '\n"," 'its full force, for poor old Peebles’ body had not been the ground that this '\n"," 'swirling water offered. Daisy JEtta literally leaped backwards toward him, '\n"," 'and the water around her tracks spouted upward in hot steam. The sound of '\n"," 'her engine ran up and up, broke, took on the rhythmic, uneven beat of a '\n"," 'swing drummer. She threw herself from side to side like a cat with a bag '\n"," 'over its head. Kelly stepped a little closer, hoping for another bolt to '\n"," 'come from the clamp in his hand, but there was none, for— “The circuit '\n"," 'breaker!” cried Kelly. He threw the holder up on the deck plate of the Seven '\n"," 'in front of the seat, and ran across the little beach to the welder. He '\n"," 'reached behind the switchboard, got his thumb on the contact hinge and '\n"," 'jammed it down. Daisy Etta leaped again, and then again, and suddenly her '\n"," 'motor stopped. Heat in turbulent waves blurred the air over her. The little '\n"," 'gas tank for the starting motor went out with a cannon’s roar, and the big '\n"," 'fuel tank, still holding thirty-odd gallons of Diesel oil followed. It '\n"," 'puffed itself open rather than exploded, and threw a great curtain of flame '\n"," 'over the ground behind the machine. Motor or no motor, 72 Theodore Sturgeon '\n"," 'then, Kelly distinctly saw the tractor shudder convulsively. There was a '\n"," 'crawling movement of the whole frame, a slight wave of motion away from the '\n"," 'fuel tank, approaching the front of the machine, and moving upward from the '\n"," 'tracks. It culminated in the crown of the radiator core, just in front of '\n"," 'the radiator cap; and suddenly an area of six or seven square inches '\n"," 'literally blurred around the edges. For a second, then, it was normal, and '\n"," 'finally it slumped molten, and liquid metal ran down the sides, throwing out '\n"," 'little sparks as it encountered what was left of the charred paint. And only '\n"," 'then was Kelly conscious of agony in his left hand. He looked down. The '\n"," 'welding machine’s generator had stopped, though the motor was still turning, '\n"," 'having smashed the friable coupling on its drive shaft. Smoke poured from '\n"," 'the generator, which had become little more than a heap of slag. Kelly did '\n"," 'not scream, though, until he looked and saw what had happened to his hand— '\n"," 'When he could see straight again, he called for Tom, and there was no '\n"," 'answer. At last he saw something out in the water, and plunged in after it. '\n"," 'The splash of cold salt water on his left hand he hardly felt, for the '\n"," 'numbness of shock had set in. He grabbed at Tom’s shirt with his good hand, '\n"," 'and then the. ground seemed to pull itself out from under his feet. That was '\n"," 'it, then—a deep hole right off the beach. The Seven had rim right to the '\n"," 'edge of it, had kept Tom there out of his depth and— He flailed wildly, '\n"," 'struck out for the beach, so near and so hard to get to. He gulped a '\n"," 'stinging lungful of brine, and only the lovely shock of his knee striking '\n"," 'solid beach kept him from giving up to the luxury of choking to death. '\n"," 'Sobbing with effort, he dragged Tom’s dead weight inshore and clear of the '\n"," 'surf. It was then that he became conscious of a child’s shrill weeping; for '\n"," 'a mad moment he thought it was he himself, and then he looked and saw that '\n"," 'it was A1 Knowles. He left Tom and went over to the broken creature. “Get '\n"," 'up, you,” he snarled. The weeping only got louder. Kelly rolled him over on '\n"," 'his back—he was quite unresisting —and belted him back and forth across the '\n"," 'mouth until A1 began to choke. Then he hauled him to his feet and led him '\n"," 'over to Tom. “Kneel down, scum. Put one of your knees between his Killdozer '\n"," '73 knees.” A1 stood still. Kelly hit him again and he did as he was told. '\n"," '“Put your hands on his lower ribs. There. O.K. Lean, you rat. Now sit back.” '\n"," 'He sat down, holding his left wrist in his right hand, letting the blood '\n"," 'drop from the ruined hand. “Lean. Hold it—sit back. Lean. Sit. Lean. Sit.” '\n"," 'Soon Tom sighed and began to vomit weakly, and after that he was all right. '\n"," 'This is the story of Daisy Etta, the bulldozer that went mad and had a life '\n"," 'of its own, and not the story of the missile test that they don’t talk about '\n"," 'except to refer to it as the missile test that they don’t talk about. But '\n"," 'you may have heard about it for all that—rumors, anyway. The rumor has it '\n"," 'that an early IRBM tested out a radically new controls system by proving '\n"," 'conclusively that it did not work. It was a big bird and contained much '\n"," 'juice, and flew far, far afield. Rumor goes on to assert that a) it alighted '\n"," 'somewhere in the unmapped rain forests of South America and that b) there '\n"," 'were no casualties. What they really don’t talk about is the closely guarded '\n"," 'report asserting that both a) and b) are false. There are only two people '\n"," '(aside from yourself, now) who know for sure that though a) is certainly '\n"," 'false, b) is strangely true, and there were indeed no casualties. A1 Knowles '\n"," 'may well know it too, but he doesn’t count. It happened two days after the '\n"," 'death of Daisy Etta, as Tom and Kelly sat in (of all places) the coolth of '\n"," 'the ruined temple. They were poring over paper and pencil, trying to '\n"," 'complete the impossible task of making a written statement of what had '\n"," 'happened on the island, and why they and their company had failed to '\n"," 'complete their contract. They had found Chub and Harris, and had buried them '\n"," 'next to the other three. A1 Knowles was back in the shadows, tied up, '\n"," 'because they had heard him raving in his sleep, and it seemed he could not '\n"," 'believe Daisy was dead and he still wanted to go around killing operators '\n"," 'for her. They knew that there must be an investigation, and they knew just '\n"," 'how far their story would go; and having escaped a monster like Daisy Etta, '\n"," 'they found life too sweet to want any part of it spent under observation or '\n"," 'in jail. The warhead of the missile struck near the edge of their 74 '\n"," 'Theodore Sturgeon camp, just between the pyramid of fuel drums and the '\n"," 'dynamite stores. The second stage alighted a moment later two miles away, in '\n"," 'the vicinity of the five graves. Kelly and Tom stumbled out to the rim of '\n"," 'the mesa, and for a long while watched the jetsam fall and the flotsam rise. '\n"," 'It was Kelly who guessed what must have happened, and “Bless their clumsy '\n"," 'little hearts,” he said happily. And he took the scribbled papers from Tom '\n"," 'and tore them across. But Tom shook his head, and thumbed back at the mound. '\n"," '•‘He’ll talk.” “Him?” said Kelly, with such profound eloquence in his tone '\n"," 'that he clearly evoked the image of A1 Knowles, with his mumbling voice and '\n"," 'his drooling mouth and his wide glazed eyes. “Let him,” Kelly said, and tore '\n"," 'the papers again. So they let him. \\\\ CACTUS DANCE The book, they decided, '\n"," 'would bring Fortley Grantham back East if nothing else would, and at first '\n"," 'I’d agreed with them. Later, I didn’t know. Later still, I hardly cared, for '\n"," 'it grew heavy in my pack. Once, somewhere in the desert between Picacho and '\n"," 'Vekol, two prospectors found me squatted on the scorching sand, heat-mad, '\n"," 'dreaming out loud. It wouldn’t do for them to explain to me about the '\n"," 'puncture in my canteen; I insisted that the book had soaked up my water as I '\n"," 'walked, and I could get it back by wringing it out. I still have the book, '\n"," 'and on it still are my teethmarks. By train and stage and horse and mule I '\n"," 'went, and, when I had to, on foot. I cursed the Territories in general and '\n"," 'Arizona in particular. I cursed Prescott and Phoenix and Maricopa; Sacaton '\n"," 'on the Gila River Reservation and Snowflake on Silver Creek. At Brownell in '\n"," 'the Quijotas I learned that William Howard Taft had signed the enabling act '\n"," 'that would make a state of that hellish country, and thereafter^I cursed him '\n"," 'too. From time to time I even cursed myself and the stubborn streak which '\n"," 'ran counter to comfort and career and intelligence itself—it would have been '\n"," 'so simple, so wise, to go back to the green lawns of the Institute, the '\n"," 'tinkle of teacups, to soft polite laughter and the coolness of ivied '\n"," 'libraries. But most of all—from his books to his beard, from his scalp to '\n"," 'his scholarship—I cursed Fortley Grantham, who had leaped from the envied '\n"," 'position of the Pudley Chair in Botany into this dehydrated wilderness. He '\n"," 'could have died under the wheels of a brewery-dray, and I’d have wept and '\n"," 'honored him. He might have risen to be Dean, perhaps even to Chairman. '\n"," 'Failing these things, if he felt he must immolate himself in this special '\n"," 'pocket of Hell, why could he not resign? But no, not Fortley Grantham. He '\n"," 'simply stayed out West, drifting, faintly radiating rumors that he was '\n"," 'alive. If mail ever reached him, he never answered it. If he intended to 75 '\n"," '76 Theodore Sturgeon return, he informed no one. He would not come back, he '\n"," 'would not be decently dead, he would not resign. And I wanted that Chair! I '\n"," 'had worked for it. I had earned it. What was I to do—wait for some sort of '\n"," 'Enoch Arden divorce between Grantham and the Chair, so that he would be '\n"," 'legally dead and the Chair legally vacant? No, I must find him or his grave, '\n"," 'bring him back or prove him dead. His last letter had come from Silver King, '\n"," 'and at Silver King they told me he’d gone to Florence. He had not, and I was '\n"," 'tired and sick when I got there to learn that. A Mohave up from Arizola had '\n"," 'seen him, though, and from there the trail led along the Union Pacific to '\n"," 'Red Rock and then to the railhead at Silverbell. Had it not been for a man '\n"," 'of the cloth at Silverbell, a Reverend Sightly, I’d have lost the trail '\n"," 'altogether. But the good man told me, with horror in his voice, of the '\n"," 'orgies indulged in by the local Indians, who sat in a ring around a fire '\n"," 'gobbling mescal buttons and having visions. I took the trouble to correct '\n"," 'the fellow as to the source of the narcotic, which comes from the peyotl and '\n"," 'not from the mescal at all, whereupon he grew positively angry with me—not, '\n"," 'as I first supposed, because I had found him in error, but because he took '\n"," 'me to be “that unholy scoundrel who has brought the gifts of science to aid '\n"," 'and abet the ignorant savage in his degraded viciousriess.” When at last I '\n"," 'convinced the reverend of the innocence of my presence and person, he '\n"," 'apologized and explained to me that a renegade botanist was loose in the '\n"," 'desert, finding the rare and fabled peyotl with unheard-of accuracy, and '\n"," 'trading the beastly stuff to whoever wanted it. From that point on the trail '\n"," 'was long and winding, but at least it was clear. When I could, I inquired '\n"," 'after Grantham, and when no one had heard of Grantham I had merely to ask '\n"," 'about the problem of obtaining mescal buttons. Always there were stories of '\n"," 'the white man who was not a prospector nor a miner nor a drummer nor '\n"," 'anything else but the purveyor of peyotl. He was a tall, broad man with a '\n"," 'red-and-silver beard and a way of cocking his head to one side a bit when he '\n"," 'spoke. That was Grantham, all right—may the vultures gulp his eyeballs and '\n"," 'die of it. . . . Between the Eagle Tails and Castle Dome is the head of '\n"," 'Posas Valley, and at its head is a filthy little oasis called Kofa. Cactus '\n"," 'Dance 77 I confess I was happy to see it. It was August, and the heat and '\n"," 'the glare had put knobs like knuckles in my sinus tissues; I could feel them '\n"," 'grind together as breathed. I was afoot, the spavined nag I had bought in '\n"," 'Arlington having died in New Water Pass. I had a burro for my pack and gear, '\n"," 'and it was all she could handle. She was old and purblind, and if she had '\n"," 'left her strength and durability behind with her youth, she had at least '\n"," 'left her stubbornness too. She carried the little she could and let me walk. '\n"," 'I could hardly have been more depressed. I had little money left, and less '\n"," 'hope. My canteen was a quarter-full of tepid mud which smelled faintly of '\n"," 'the dead horned toad I’d seen in the waterhole in the pass. My feet hurt and '\n"," 'my hip-joints creaked audibly as I plodded along. Half silently I mumbled '\n"," 'what I once facetiously had called my “Anthem for Grantham,” a sort of chant '\n"," 'which ran: ... I shall people his classroom with morons. 1 shall have him '\n"," 'seduced by his chambermaid and 1 shall report it to the Dean. I shall '\n"," 'publicly refute his contention that the Echinopsis cacti are separate from '\n"," 'the genus Cereus. 1 shall lock him in his rooms at banquet time on Founder’s '\n"," 'Day. I shall uproot his windowboxes and spread rumors about him with the '\n"," 'Alumni Association ... It was the only way I had left of cheering myself up. '\n"," 'For weeks I had trailed the rumors of Grantham’s peyotl traffic farther and '\n"," 'farther from peyotl grounds. It was sahuro country here, and all about they '\n"," 'stretched their yearning, other-worldly arms out and upward, as if in search '\n"," 'for a lover who might forget their thorns. Down the valley, westward, was a '\n"," 'veritable forest of Dracenoideae, called yucca hereabouts. I did not know if '\n"," 'yucca and peyotl could coexist, and I thought not. If not, my main method of '\n"," 'trailing Grantham was lost. In such hopeless depression I staggered into '\n"," 'Kofa, which, primitive as it was, afforded a chance of better company than '\n"," 'my black thoughts and a doddering burro. I knew better than to hope for a '\n"," 'restaurant and so went to the sole source of refreshment, the bar. It seemed '\n"," 'so dark inside, after the merciless radiance outside, that I stood blinking '\n"," 'like an owl for thirty seconds before I could orient myself. At last I could '\n"," 'locate the bar and deduce that man stood behind it. I croaked out an order '\n"," 'for a glass of milk, which the bar- 78 Theodore Sturgeon tender greeted with '\n"," 'a thundering laugh and the quotation of a price so fantastic that I was '\n"," 'forced to order whisky, which I despise. The fool’s nostrils spread when I '\n"," 'demanded water with the whisky, but he said nothing as he poured it from a '\n"," 'stone jar. I took the two glasses as far back in that ’dobe cavern as I '\n"," 'could get from him, and slumped down into a chair. For a long moment there '\n"," 'was nothing in my universe but the feel of my lips in the water, which, '\n"," 'though alkaline, was wet and cool. Only then, leaning back and breathing '\n"," 'deeply, did I realize that someone sat across the table from me. He cocked '\n"," 'his head on one side and said, “Well, well! If Mahomet won’t come to the '\n"," 'mountain, the Institute brings forth a mouse.” “Dr. Grantham!” He watched me '\n"," 'for a moment and then laughed. It was the same laugh, the deep rumble, the '\n"," 'flash of strong white teeth which I used to envy so much. His eyes opened '\n"," 'aftej it and he leaned forward. “Better shut your mouth now, sonny.” I had '\n"," 'not realized it was open. I shut it and felt it with my fingers while I '\n"," 'looked at him. He was in worn Levi’s and a faded shirt to which had been '\n"," 'sewn four or five extra pockets and a sort of shoulder cape with its lower '\n"," 'edge cut into a fringe in the buckskin style. His hair and beard were '\n"," 'untrimmed. His hands seemed stiff with yellowish calluses in the palms, and '\n"," 'they were indifferently clean. A broad strap hung over one shoulder and '\n"," 'across his chest to support a large leather pouch. He was a far cry from '\n"," 'Fortley Grantham, M.A., F.B.S., D. Sc., with lifetime tenure of the Pudley '\n"," 'Chair in Botany at the Institute; yet there was no mistaking him. “Big '\n"," 'Horn!” he roared to the bartender. “Set ’em up here. This here’s a perfessor '\n"," 'from back East an’ we’re goin’ to have a faculty meetin’.” That’s how he '\n"," 'pronounced it—“perfessor.” He dealt me a stunning thump on the left biceps. '\n"," '“Right, Chip?” “Chip?” I looked behind me; there was no one there. And the '\n"," 'bartender’s name obviously was Big Horn. It penetrated that he was calling '\n"," 'me Chip. “You surely haven’t forgotten my name, Doctor.” “I surely ain’t, '\n"," 'Doctor,” he said mimicking my voice. He smiled engagingly. “Everybody’s got '\n"," 'two names,” he explained, “the name they’s born with an’ the name I think '\n"," 'they Cactus Dance 79 ought to have. The name you ought to have, now, it’s '\n"," 'Chip. There’s a little crittur lives in an’ out of the rocks, sits up '\n"," 'straight an’ looks surprised, holds up its two little paws, an’ lets its '\n"," 'front teeth hang out. Chipmunk, they call it back East, though it’s a rock '\n"," 'squirrel other places. Get me, Chip?” I put both hands on the table and '\n"," 'pressed my lips together. Big Horn arrived just then and put more whisky '\n"," 'down before me. I said coldly, “No, thank you.” Big Horn paid absolutely no '\n"," 'attention to me, but walked away leaving the whisky where it was. “Come on, '\n"," 'climb down. This ain’t the hallowed halls.” “That is the one thing I’m sure '\n"," 'of,” I said haughtily. He shook his head in pity. He looked down at his '\n"," 'glass and his eyebrows twitched. He made no attempt to say anything and I '\n"," 'began to feel that perhaps I, not he, should be making the overtures. I '\n"," 'said, for want of anything better, “I suppose ‘Big Horn’ is another of your '\n"," 'appellations.” He nodded. “To him it’s a sort of compliment.” He laughed. '\n"," '“Some people carry their vanity in the damnedest places.” I felt I should '\n"," 'not pursue this, somehow. He tilted his head and said, “You’re not jumpin’ '\n"," 'salty because I call you Chip?” “I don’t read a compliment into it.” '\n"," '“Shucks, now, son—they’re real purty little animals!” He waved. “Drink up '\n"," 'now, an’ warm yoreself. I’m not insultin’ you. You wouldn’t be wonderin’ '\n"," 'about it if I did—I’d see to that. Don’t you understand, I was callin’ you '\n"," 'Chip—privately, I mean—from the minute I saw you, years back.” “I was '\n"," 'beginning to think,” I said acidly, “that you had forgotten everything that '\n"," 'happened before you came to Arizona.” “Never fear, colleague,” he intoned, '\n"," 'in precisely the voice that once boomed through the lecture-halls, “I can '\n"," 'still distinguish a rhizome from a tuber and a faculty tea from deep '\n"," 'hypnosis.” Instantly he reverted to this appalling new self. “I got a handle '\n"," 'too. They Call me Buttons.” “To what characteristic is that attributed?” He '\n"," 'looked at me admiringly. “I druther listen to that kind of talk than a '\n"," 'thirsty muleskinner cussin’.” He pulled at the thongs that tied down the '\n"," 'flap of his pouch, reached in, and tossed a handful of what seemed to be '\n"," 'small desiccated mushrooms to me. 80 Theodore Sturgeon I picked one up, '\n"," 'squeezed it, turned it over, smelled it. “Lophophora.” \\\\ “Good boy,” he '\n"," 'said sincerely. “Know which one?” “Williamsii, I think.” “Sharp as a '\n"," 'sidewinder’s front fang,” he said, giving me another of those buffets. '\n"," '“Hereabouts they’re mescal buttons.” “Oh,” I said. “Oh yes. So they call you '\n"," 'Buttons. You—uh —are rather widely known in connection with this—uh— '\n"," 'vegetable.” He laughed. “I didn’t think a botanist ever used the word '\n"," '‘vegetable’.” I ignored this. I rose. “One moment, please. I think I can '\n"," 'show you that you have a wider reputation in this matter than you realize.” '\n"," 'He made as if to stop me but did not. I went out to my burro. She was '\n"," 'standing like a stone statue in the blazing sun, her upper lip just touching '\n"," 'the surface of the water in the horse-trough, breathing water-vapor in '\n"," 'patient ecstasy., I dug into my pack and wormed out the book. Inside again, '\n"," 'I placed it carefully by Grantham’s glass. He looked at it, at me, then '\n"," 'picked it up. Holding it high, he moved his head back and his chin in with '\n"," 'the gesture of a seaman forcing his horizoned eyes to help with threading a '\n"," 'needle. “Journal of the Botanical Scienceshe read. “Catalogue, Volume four, '\n"," 'revised. 1910, huh? Right up to the minute. Oh bully. He squinted. '\n"," '“Cactaceae. Phyla and genera reclassified. Hey, Big Horn,” he roared, “the '\n"," 'professor here’s got reclassified genera.” The bartender clucked '\n"," 'sympathetically. Grantham leafed rapidly. “Nice. Nice.” “We thought you’d '\n"," 'like it. Look up lophophora He did. Suddenly he grunted as if I had kneed '\n"," 'him, and stabbed a horny forefinger onto the page. “Lophophora granthamii’ '\n"," 'I’ll be Billy-be-damned! So they took note of old Grantham, did they?” “They '\n"," 'did. As I said, you are widely known in connection with peyotl.” He '\n"," 'chuckled. He made no attempt to hide the fact that he was vastly pleased. '\n"," '“When you were sending back specimens and reports, you Cactus Dance 81* were '\n"," 'of great value to us,” I pointed out. I coughed. “Something seems—ah—to have '\n"," 'happened.” He kept his eyes on the listing, wagging his big head '\n"," 'delightedly. “Yup, yup,” he said. “Something happened.” He suddenly snapped '\n"," 'the book closed and slid it across to me. “Last thing in the world I ever '\n"," 'expected to see again.” “I didn’t think you would, either,” I said bitterly. '\n"," '“Dr. Grantham—” “Buttons,” he corrected. “Dr. Grantham, I have traveled '\n"," 'across this continent and through some of the most Godforsaken topography on '\n"," 'earth just to put this volume in your hands.” He started. I think that he '\n"," 'realized only then that I had sought him out, that this was no accident on a '\n"," 'field trip. “You didn’t!” He lifted his glass and tossed it to his lips, '\n"," 'found it empty, looked around in a brief confusion, then reached and took '\n"," 'mine. He wiped his mouth with the bristly back of his hand. “What in hell '\n"," 'for?” I tapped the book. “If I may speak frankly—” “Fire away.” “We felt '\n"," 'that this might—uh—bring you back to your senses.” “I got real healthy '\n"," 'senses.” “Dr. Grantham, you don’t understand. You—you—” I floundered, picked '\n"," 'up my second whisky and drank some of it. It made my eyes stream. My throat '\n"," 'made a sort of death-rattle and suddenly I could breathe again. I could feel '\n"," 'the whisky sinking a tap-root down my esophagus while tendrils raced up and '\n"," 'out to my ear-lobes where, budding, they began to heat. “You left for a '\n"," 'field trip and did not return. You were granted your sabbatical year to '\n"," 'cover this because of your prominence in the field and because of the '\n"," 'excellence of the collections you sent back; specimens such as the peyotl '\n"," 'now named for you. Then the specimens dwindled and ceased, the reports '\n"," 'dwindled and ceased—and then nothing, nothing at all.” He scratched his '\n"," 'thick pelt of red-and-silver. “Reckon I just figured it didn’t matter much '\n"," 'no more.” “Didn’t matter?” I realized I squeaked, and then that my voice was '\n"," 'high and nagging, but I no longer cared. “Don’t you 82 Theodore Sturgeon '\n"," 'realize that as long as you are alive you hold the Pudley chair?” I saw the '\n"," 'glint in his eye and clutched his wrist. “If you shout out to that bartender '\n"," 'that you have a Pudley chair, I’ll—I’ll—” I whispered, but could not finish '\n"," 'for the cannonade of rich laughter he sent up. I sat tense and furious, '\n"," 'helpless to do or say anything until he finished. At last he wiped his eyes. '\n"," '“I’m sorry,” he said sincerely, quite as if he were civilized. “You caught '\n"," 'me off guard. I’m really sorry, Professor.” “It’s all right,” I lied. '\n"," '“Doctor, I want that chair if you don’t. I’ve worked hard for it. I’ve '\n"," 'earned it. I—I need it.” “Well gosh, son, go to it. It’s all yours.” I had '\n"," 'wanted to hear that for so long, I’d dreamed of it so much—and now, hearing '\n"," 'it, I became furiously angry. “Why didn’t you resign?” I shouted. “That’s '\n"," 'all you had to do, resign, put a two-cent stamp on an envelope, save me all '\n"," 'this work, this worry—I nearly died with a hole in my canteen,” I wept, '\n"," 'waving at the pottery kiln they call “outdoors” in this terrible land. “Two '\n"," 'horses I killed—my work is waiting—my books, students—” I found myself '\n"," 'patting the table, inarticulate, glaring into his astonished eyes. “Why?” I '\n"," 'yelled. “Why, why, why—” I moaned. He got up and came round the table and '\n"," 'stood behind me. On my shoulders he put two huge warm hands like epaulettes. '\n"," '“I didn’t know, son. I—damn it, I did know, I guess.” I hated myself for it, '\n"," 'but my shoulders shook suddenly. He squeezed them. “I did know. I reckon I '\n"," 'just didn’t care.” He took his hands away and went back to his chair. He '\n"," 'must have made a sign because Big Horn came back with more whisky. After a '\n"," 'time I said, with difficulty, “All the way out here I hated you, understand '\n"," 'that? I’m not—I don’t—I mean, I never hated anything before, I lived with '\n"," 'books and people who talk quietly and—and scholastic honors . . . Damn it, '\n"," 'Dr. Grantham, I admired and respected you, you understand? If you’d stayed '\n"," 'at the Institute for the next fifty years, then for fifty years I’d’ve been '\n"," 'happy with it. I admired the Chair and the man who was in it, things were '\n"," 'the way they should be. Well, if you didn’t want to stay, good. If you '\n"," 'didn’t want the Chair, good. But if you care so little about it—and I '\n"," 'respect your judgment— You understand?” Cactus Dance 83 “Oh gosh yes. Shut '\n"," 'up awhile. Drink some whisky. You’re going to bust yourself up again.” . We '\n"," 'sat quietly for a time. At length he said, “I didn’t care. I admit it. Not '\n"," 'for the Institute nor the Chair nor you. I should’ve cared about you, or '\n"," 'anyone else who wanted it as bad as you do. I’m sorry. I’m real sorry. I '\n"," 'got—involved. Other things came to be important.” “Peyotl. Selling drugs to '\n"," 'the Indians,” I snarled. “You’ve probably got a nice little heap of gold '\n"," 'dust salted away!” The most extraordinary series of expressions chased each '\n"," 'other across his face. I think if the first one—blind fury— had stayed, I’d '\n"," 'have been dead in the next ten seconds. “I don’t haye any money,” he said '\n"," 'gently. “Just enough for a stake every once in a while, so I can—” He stared '\n"," 'out at the yellow-white glare. Then, as if he had not left an unfinished '\n"," 'sentence, he murmured, “Peyotl. Professor, you know better than to equate '\n"," 'these buttons with opium and hashish. Listen, right near here, in the '\n"," 'seventeenth century, there used to be a mission called Santo de Jesus '\n"," 'Peyotes. Sort of looks as if the Spanish priests thought pretty well of it, '\n"," 'hm? “Listen,” he said urgently, “Uncle Sam brought suit against an Indian by '\n"," 'the name of Nah-qua-tah-tuck, because Uncle’s mails had been used to ship '\n"," 'peyotl around. When the defense witnesses were through testifying about how '\n"," 'peyotl-eaters quit drinking, went back to their wives, and began to work '\n"," 'hard; when a sky pilot name of Prescott testified about his weekly services '\n"," 'where he served the stuff to his parish, and they were the most God-fearing '\n"," 'parish in the Territories, why, Uncle Sam just packed up and went right back '\n"," 'home.” I knew something of the forensics of the alkaloid mescaline. I said, '\n"," '“Well and good, but you haven’t told me how you— how you could—” “Easy, '\n"," 'ea—sy,” he soothed, and just in time too. “Chip, you’re the injured party, '\n"," 'for sure. I wish I could—well, make up for it, part way.” “Perhaps we’d just '\n"," 'better not talk about it.” “No, wait.” He studied me. “Chip, I’m going to '\n"," 'tell you about it. I’m going to tell you how a man like me could do what '\n"," 'he’s done, how he could find something more important than all the '\n"," 'Institutes running. But—” I waited. 84 Theodore Sturgeon “—I don’t expect '\n"," 'you to believe it. Want to hear it anyway? It’s the truth.” I thought about '\n"," 'it. If I left him now, the Chair waiting for me, my personal and academic '\n"," 'futures assured—wouldn’t that content me? It wouldn’t, I answered myself. '\n"," 'Because Grantham wouldn’t return or resign, I’d lost two years, almost. I '\n"," 'should know why I’d lost them. I had to know. I’d lost them because Grantham '\n"," 'was callous and didn’t care; or because Grantham was crazy; or because of '\n"," 'something much bigger “than all the Institutes running.” Which? “Tell me, '\n"," 'then.” He hesitated, then rose. “I will.” He thumped his chest, and it '\n"," 'sounded like the grumble you hear sometimes after heat lightning. “But I’ll '\n"," 'tell it my way. Come on.” “Where?” He tossed a thumb toward the west. “The '\n"," 'forest.” The “forest” was the heavy growth of Draconaenoideae I’d seen down '\n"," 'the valley. It was quite a haul and I was still tired, but I got up anyway. '\n"," 'Grantham gave me an approving look. He went outside and unstrapped my pack '\n"," 'from the burro. “We’ll let Big Horn hold this.” He took it inside and '\n"," 'emerged a moment later. “Why don’t you leave your pouch?” Grantham twinkled. '\n"," '“They call me Buttons, remember? I never leave this anywhere.” We walked for '\n"," 'nearly an hour in silence. The yucca appeared along the trail in ones and '\n"," 'twos, then in clusters and clumps with spaces between. Their presence seemed '\n"," 'to affect Grantham in some way. He began to walk with his head up, instead '\n"," 'of fixing his eyes on the path, and his mind God knows where. “See there?” '\n"," 'he said once. He pointed to what was left of a shack, weed-grown and ruined. '\n"," 'I nodded but he had nothing more to offer. A little later, as we passed a '\n"," 'fine specimen of melocactus, the spiny “barrel,” Grantham murmured, “It’s '\n"," 'easy to fall under the spell of the cacti. You know. It caught you a '\n"," 'thousand miles away from here. Ever smell the cereus blooming at night, '\n"," 'Chip? Ever wonder what makes the Turk’s-head wear a fez? Why can’t a '\n"," 'chinch-bug make cochineal out of Cactus Dance 85 anything but nopal? And why '\n"," 'the spines; why? When most of ’em would be safe from everyone and '\n"," 'everything, even sliced up with gravy on ...” I answered none of the '\n"," 'questions, because at first I thought them foolish. I thought-, it’s like '\n"," 'asking why hair grows on a cat’s back but not on its nose—then gradually I '\n"," 'began to yield, partly because it seemed after all that a cactus is indeed a '\n"," 'stranger thing than a cat—or a human, for that matter; and partly because it '\n"," 'was Grantham, the Grantham, who murmured these things. “This will do,” he '\n"," 'said suddenly* and stopped. The trail had widened and then disappeared, to '\n"," 'continue three hundred yards down the valley where again the Yucca grew '\n"," 'heavily. Flash floods had cut away the earth to leave an irregular sandy '\n"," 'shelf on the north side, and Grantham swung up on this and squatted on his '\n"," 'heels. I followed slowly and sat beside him. He bowed his head and pressed '\n"," 'his heavy eyebrow ridges against his knees, hugging his legs hard. He '\n"," 'radiated tension, and, just as noticeably, the tension went away. He raised '\n"," 'his head slowly and looked off down the valley. I followed his gaze. The '\n"," 'bald hills were touched to gold by the dropping sun, and their convoluted '\n"," 'shadows were a purple that was black, or a black that was purple. Grantham '\n"," 'began to talk. “Back there. That shack.” He paused. I recalled it. He said, '\n"," '“Used to be a family there. Mexican. Miguel, face as hard and bald as those '\n"," 'hills, and a great fat wife like a suet pudding with a toupee. Inside, '\n"," 'Miguel was soft and useless and cruel the way only lazy people can be cruel. '\n"," 'And the wife was hickory with thorns, inside, with another kind of cruelty. '\n"," 'Miguel would never go out of his way to be kind. The woman would travel '\n"," 'miles, work days on end, to be cruel. “Kids.” Somewhere a lizard scuffled, '\n"," 'somewhere a gopher sent the letter B in rapid, expert Morse. I held two '\n"," 'fingers together, and with one eye closed used the fingers to cover the sun '\n"," 'limb to limb. When the lower limb peeped under my finger, Grantham’s breath '\n"," 'hissed in and out quickly, once each, and he said, “They had kids. Two or '\n"," 'three pigeon-breasted toddlers. One other. But I met her later. “That was '\n"," 'when I first came, when I was doing that collect- 86 Theodore Sturgeon ing '\n"," 'and reporting that impressed you all so much. I arranged with Miguel the '\n"," 'same deal I had with others before: he was to keep his eyes open for this '\n"," 'plant or that, or an unseasonal flower; and certain kinds he was to cut and '\n"," 'save for me, and others he was to locate and lead me to .He’d get a copper '\n"," 'or two for what I liked, and once in a while a dime just to keep ’em going. '\n"," 'Quite a trick whenno one speaks the other’s language and the signs you make '\n"," 'mean different things all around. Still, the law of averages figures here '\n"," 'too, and I always got my money’s worth. “I matie my deal and he called in '\n"," 'the family, all but one, and when all the heads were nodding and the '\n"," 'jabbering stopped, I waved my hand and headed this way. Miguel shouted '\n"," 'something at me a moment later, and I turned and saw them all clustered '\n"," 'together looking at me bug-eyed, but I didn’t know what he meant, so I just '\n"," 'waved and walked on. They didn’t wave back. “I’d about reached where we’re '\n"," 'sitting now when I heard a sort of growl up ahead. I’d been looking at the '\n"," 'flora all the way up, and never noticed the things I’d smell or hear or '\n"," 'just—just feel now. Anyway, I looked up and the first thing I saw was a '\n"," 'little girl standing here in the cut. The second thing was a black roiling '\n"," 'wall of water and cloud towering up and over me, coming down like a '\n"," 'dynamited wall. The third thing was a gout of white spray thirty feet tall '\n"," 'squirting out of the landscape not a quarter of a mile away. “How long\" does '\n"," 'it take to figure things out at a time like that? It was like standing still '\n"," 'for forty minutes, thinking it out laboriously, and at the same time being '\n"," 'able to move only two feet a minute like a slow loris. Actually I suppose I '\n"," 'looked up, then jumped, but a whole lot happened in that second. “I shouted '\n"," 'and was beside the girl in two steps. She didn’t move. She was looking at '\n"," 'the sky and the spume with the largest, darkest eyes I have ever seen. She '\n"," 'was a thin little thing like the rest of Miguel’s litter. She wasn’t pretty; '\n"," 'her face was badly pocked and either she’d lost a front tooth or so or the '\n"," 'second set had never made up its mind to go on with the job. “Thing is, she '\n"," 'was a native and I wasn’t. To me the flash flood was a danger, but she was '\n"," 'completely unafraid. It wasn’t a stupid calm. If ever there was a package of '\n"," 'sensitivity, this * Cactus Dance 87 was it. How can I describe it? Look, you '\n"," 'know how a beloved house-cat watches you enter a room? The paws are turned '\n"," 'under, the eyes are one-third open, and the purr goes on and on like a huge '\n"," 'and sleepy bee. The cat can do that because it means no violence to you and '\n"," 'you mean no violence to it. “Now imagine coming suddenly on a wild deer—how '\n"," 'would you feel if it looked up at you with just such fearlessness? It was as '\n"," 'if violence couldn’t occur near this girl. It was unthinkable. Before her '\n"," 'was this hellish wall of water and beside her was a rather large bearded '\n"," 'stranger shouting like a rag-peddler, and there she stood, awake, aware, not '\n"," 'stunned, not afraid. “I scooped her up and made for the bank. I—I had help. '\n"," 'I thought at the time it was the vanguard of that tall press of wind. Later '\n"," 'I thought—I don’t know what I thought, but anyway, the yuccas folded toward '\n"," 'me, tangling their leathery swords together; even at their tips I had '\n"," 'something thick as your arm and strong as an anchor-cable to take hold of. I '\n"," 'swung up past one, two, three of them that way and then the williwaw came '\n"," 'down shouting and knocked me flat as a domino. “I twisted as I fell so I '\n"," 'wouldn’t land on the child. I held her tight to me with my right arm, and I '\n"," 'threw up my left as some sort of guard over both of us. I distinctly saw a '\n"," 'forty-foot Chaya cactus twist past overhead, and then I was hit. By what, I '\n"," 'couldn’t say, but it hit my left forearm and my left fist came down on my '\n"," 'chin, and that, for me, was the end of that part of the adventure. “When I '\n"," 'opened my eyes I thought first I’d gone blind, and then it came to me that '\n"," 'it was night, a black, scudding night, cold the way only this crazy, '\n"," 'either-or-and-all-the-way country can get. I was shaking like a '\n"," 'gravel-sorter. Something had hold of my arm, which hurt, and I tried to pull '\n"," 'it away and couldn’t. “It was the kid. She was crouched beside me, holding '\n"," 'my left forearm in both her hands. She wasn’t shivering. Her hands were '\n"," 'warm, too, though I suppose anything over forty degrees would feel warm just '\n"," 'then. I stopped pulling and heaved up to see what I could see. The scud '\n"," 'parted and let a sick flicker of moon show through, and that helped. “I had '\n"," 'a five-inch gash in my arm—up and down, fortunately, not across, so it had '\n"," 'missed any major blood-vessel. I Theodore Sturgeon 88 could see the two ends '\n"," 'of the cut, but between those ends lay the girl’s hands. Their pressure was '\n"," 'firm and unwavering, and clotted blood had cemented her to me nice as you '\n"," 'please. And she’d been sitting there holding the edges of the cut '\n"," 'together—how long? Three hours? Four, five? I didn’t know. I don’t know now. '\n"," '“She tugged at me gently and we got our feet under us. We scrabbled down the '\n"," 'bank until I could see the deep, strong creek that hadn’t been there that '\n"," 'afternoon. We went downstream a piece until the bank shelved, squatted by '\n"," 'the edge, and got her hands and my arm together into the water. In a few '\n"," 'moments she worked a hand free, then the other. I bled a bit then, but not '\n"," 'too much, and she helped me tie on my kerchief. “I sat down, partly to rest, '\n"," 'mostly to look at her. She looked right back, with that same fearlessness '\n"," 'showing even in the scudding dark. I thanked her but she didn’t say '\n"," 'anything. I grinned at her but she didn’t smile. She just looked at me, not '\n"," 'appraising, not defiant, just liking what she saw, and unafraid. “I took her '\n"," 'back to Miguel’s. The old lady was raising particular hell, shaking her '\n"," 'fists at the sky. Their rotten corral-pole was down and they’d lost two head '\n"," 'of their hairy, bony, bot-ridden scrub cattle. I got a vague impression of '\n"," 'two of the little ones staring big-eyed and scared from the drafty corner. I '\n"," 'propelled the girl forward to the doorway and the old sow put out a claw and '\n"," 'snatched her inside. I thought she raised her fist but I wasn’t ready to '\n"," 'believe anything like that. Not that night. Then the door was closed and I '\n"," 'slogged off toward Kofa. “About ten minutes later I saw her again, standing '\n"," 'by the bank just out of the shadows of the yucca. If the moon hadn’t flashed '\n"," 'I’d have missed her altogether. She faded back into the shadows and when I '\n"," 'reached the place she was gone, though I yelled my head off. I do believe '\n"," 'she had come to see for sure if I could navigate all right. How she got '\n"," 'clear of .the house and passed me in the dark is another thing I’ll never '\n"," 'know. “It was a couple of days before I could get around easily with that '\n"," 'arm. It was badly bruised and it swelled like a goatskin bottle, but the cut '\n"," 'healed faster than a cut like that ought to. Call it clean air and a good '\n"," 'constitution, if you like. Got any makings?” Cactus Dance 89 “I don’t '\n"," 'smoke,” I said. “That’s right.” He sighed. “No matter. “Well, a couple of '\n"," 'days later I went back. Miguel had quite a pile of stuff for me. Good stuff, '\n"," 'too, a lot of it. A colchicum, or what looked like one, but without the '\n"," 'bulging ‘corm’ at the base; a gloriosa with, by God, pink petals; a Chaya '\n"," 'only eight inches tall. Lot of junk, too, of course, and maybe more '\n"," 'treasures—I wouldn’t know. I caught a movement out of the corner of my '\n"," 'eye—and there, just off Miguel’s reservation, the girl stood in the shadows. '\n"," '“Herf!” he snorted, “once in the West Indies I cut into a jungle glade and '\n"," 'saw a wild magnolia “as big as my head. It was so big, so pale in the '\n"," 'dimness that I was actually scared; might just as well’ve been a lion for a '\n"," 'second or so, the way I jumped. This kid, she gleamed out of the shadows the '\n"," 'same way. “Like the big brainless buffalo I am, I had to straighten up and '\n"," 'wave and grin, and before I could blink the old lady flashed off and '\n"," 'collared the kid. My God, you wouldn’t believe how that two-ton carcass '\n"," 'could move! She’d caught her and had cuffed her in the face, forward and '\n"," 'back, three times before I could get the slack out of my jaw* “I don’t know '\n"," 'what sort of a noise I made but whatever it was it stopped her as if I’d '\n"," 'thrown a brick. I got the girl away from her and then I went back and with '\n"," 'my machete I chopped up the specimens into ensilage. Talk about '\n"," 'substitution! I was wild! - , “When the red fog went way I conveyed to '\n"," 'Miguel that there was no chapa for him this day nor any other day when I saw '\n"," 'them strike a child. Once he got the idea he turned and bitterly berated his '\n"," 'wife, who screamed some things the gist of which was that I was an '\n"," 'ungrateful scut because she had hit the child only for bringing ho '\n"," 'specimens. Miguel bellowed something to her and then turned to me all '\n"," 'scrapes and smiles, and promised to arrange everything any way I wanted it. '\n"," '“I growled like a grampus and charged off downstream. I was mad at '\n"," 'everything and everybody. I’ve since gotten a cormless colchicum but I never '\n"," 'saw another dwarf Chaya. Well . . . the things you do . . . “I’d stamped '\n"," 'along perhaps a hundred yards before I became aware that I still held the '\n"," 'girl’s arm. I stopped at 90 - Theodore Sturgeon once and hunkered down and '\n"," 'gave her a hug and told her how sorry I was. “She had two angry welts on one '\n"," 'side of her face and three on the other; and she had those eyes; and you '\n"," 'know, those eyes were just the way they’d been when I first saw them, '\n"," 'fearless and untouched and untouchable. “I’d had a strange semi-dream the '\n"," 'day before, when I was trying to sleep through the throbbing of my arm. It '\n"," 'was a sort of visualization of what would have happened in the flood if I '\n"," 'hadn’t been there, like a cinematograph, if you’ve ever seen one of the '\n"," 'things. There she stood, and when the water reached her it turned and went '\n"," 'around her,-and the wind too, just as if she were under a bell-jar. Hm! But '\n"," 'it wasn’t like that, and here were the bruises on her face to prove it. At '\n"," 'the same time the vision was correct, for no matter what happened to her, it '\n"," 'couldn’t really reach her. See what I mean?” “Cowed,” I said. “Poor kid.” He '\n"," 'put his hands together and squeezed them for a moment. I think he was angry '\n"," 'at me. Then he relaxed. “Not cowed, Chip. You have to be afraid for that. '\n"," 'Fearless, don’t /you understand? As much fear as a granite cliff looking at '\n"," 'a hurricane, as much as a rose listening to garden shears.” “Beyond me,” • I '\n"," 'said. “Beyond me too,” he said immediately. He looked at me. “I’ll '\n"," 'stop.now?” “Stop? No!” “Very well. Don’t forget, I didn’t tell you to '\n"," 'believe me. All I said was that it was the truth.” He looked up at the sky. '\n"," '“I must hurry . . . “She didn’t answer my hug or my apologies, but somehow I '\n"," 'knew they reached the places where fear could not. Then I remembered what '\n"," 'was in my specimen bag. I’d managed to find a child’s dress in the trading '\n"," 'post at Kofa. It was white with blue polka dots all over it, made of some '\n"," 'heavy, hard-finish material that ought to wear a hole in sandpaper. I didn’t '\n"," 'think too much of it myself—it was only the best I could do—but I can’t '\n"," 'describe what happened when I handed it over. “I mean just that, Chip—I '\n"," 'can’t describe it. Look, she couldn’t or wouldn’t talk. Whether she could '\n"," 'hear or not I don’t know. And she might as well have been born without '\n"," 'Cactus Dance 91 motor nerves in her face, or at least her cheeks, because '\n"," 'not once did she ever smile. “Yet she stood looking at the dress when I '\n"," 'shook it out, and perhaps her eyes got rounder. She didn’t move, so I held '\n"," 'it up against her. She put those eyes on me and slowly brought her hands '\n"," 'together in front of her. I nodded my head and smiled and told her go ahead, '\n"," 'put it on, it’s for you. And then she—” Grantham twisted his thick '\n"," 'forefinger into and out of his beard, picked up a pebble, threw it, watching '\n"," 'studiously. “—began to glow,” he continued. “This Arizona moon, in the fall, '\n"," 'when the brush-fires shroud the sky . . . the moon’s up, full, off the hills '\n"," 'and you can’t see it, and gradually you know it’s there. It isn’t a thing, '\n"," 'it’s a place in the sky, that’s all. Then it rises higher, and the smoke '\n"," 'blows down, and it gets brighter and brighter and brighter .until— you don’t '\n"," 'know how or just when—you realize you could read a man’s palm by it. The kid '\n"," 'did that, somehow. When whatever she felt was at peak you—sort—of—had to '\n"," 'squinch up your eyes to see her.” He punched the sand. “I don’t know,” he '\n"," 'muttered. “She put up her hands to shuck out of the rag she was wearing and '\n"," 'I turned my back. In a second she danced past me, wearing the blue-dotted '\n"," 'dress. Her and that quiet, pockmarked, unsmiling little face, glowing like '\n"," 'that, spinning like a barn swallow, balancing like a gull. Ever see a bird '\n"," 'smile, Chip? A lily laugh? Does a passion-flower have to sing? Hell. I mean, '\n"," 'hell. Some people don’t have to say anything. “That was the first day I saw '\n"," 'her do what I called her Yucca Dance. She stood on the cap of a rise in the '\n"," 'yucca forest and the fresh damp buffalo grass hiding her feet. With her '\n"," 'elbows close to her sides, her forearms stretched upward and her hands out, '\n"," 'she just barely moved her fingers, and I suddenly got the idea—the still, '\n"," 'thick stem, the branching of leaves, the long slender neck and crown of '\n"," 'flowers. “I laughed like a fool and ran to the nearest cactus. I pulled two '\n"," 'firm white blossoms and went and put them in her hair, and stepped back, '\n"," 'laughing. Both of them fell out, and she made no attempt to pick them up. I '\n"," 'caught her eyes then, and I got the general idea that I’d made some sort of '\n"," 'mistake. I stumbled back, feeling like a damn idiot, 92 Theodore Sturgeon '\n"," 'and she went back into her trance, being a yucca awaiting the wind. “And '\n"," 'when the wind came she made the only sound I ever heard from her, but for '\n"," 'her footsteps. It was, in miniature, precisely the whispering of the leather '\n"," 'leaves touching together. When the wind gusted, her whisper was with it, and '\n"," 'she leaned with—with the—other—Chip?” I said, “Yes, Grantham.” “You don’t '\n"," 'forget it, standing in her white dress with blue spots, rooted and spreading '\n"," 'and stretched, whispering in the wind. Chip?” I answered again. “You know '\n"," 'about the moth, Chip?” I said, “Pronuba yuccasella.” He grinned. It was good '\n"," 'to see his face relax. “Good entomology, for a botanist.” “Not especially,” '\n"," 'I said. “Pronuba’s a fairly botanical sort of bug.” “Mmm.” He nodded. “It '\n"," 'doesn’t eat anything but yucca nectar, and the yucca blossom can be '\n"," 'fertilized by no other insect. Chip, did you know a termite can’t digest '\n"," 'cellulose?” “Out of my line.” “Well, it can’t,” said Grantham. “But there’s '\n"," 'a bacterium lives in his belly that can. And what he excretes, the termite '\n"," 'feeds on.” “Symbiosis,” I said “Wonde^ how you’d get along,” he mused? “with '\n"," 'folks who didn’t know as much as you do? Yes,- symbiosis. Two living things '\n"," 'as dissimilar as a yucca and a moth, and neither can live without the '\n"," 'other.” “Like Republicans and Dem—” “Ah, stow it, cork it, and shove it,” '\n"," 'Grantham said bluntly. He looked at the western hills, and the light put '\n"," 'blood on his great lion’s head. “Pretty natural thing, that symbiosis. Lot '\n"," 'of it around.” He began to talk again, rapidly, with, now and again, a quick '\n"," 'glance at the darkling west. “Six months, seven, maybe, I collected around '\n"," 'here. No trouble with Miguel. He collected a bunch of weeds and sticks, but '\n"," 'once in a while he earned his keep, retroactively. The old lady kept her '\n"," 'hands off. The kid spent every day with me. I guess I Cactus Dance 93 had '\n"," 'the area pretty well sieved in four months, but I went out every day '\n"," 'anyhow.”— “I remember,” I said. “Yea, yes, I didn’t spend so many specimens. '\n"," 'Later, none. I know. I said I was sor—” For the first time I barked at him. '\n"," '“Go on with your story.” “Where—oh. The moth. Jhe moth that won’t go near '\n"," 'anything but a yucca.” I thought he had forgotten me. “Hey,” I said. “She '\n"," 'danced,” he said, examining his hands carefully in the dim light, “any time '\n"," 'it occurred to her, for a long time or a little. Or at night. At night,” he '\n"," 'said clearly, heaving himself upright and not looking at me, “the petals '\n"," 'open and the moths fly. They were a cloud around her head.” I waited. He '\n"," 'said, “It’s only the truth. And once in the late sunset, still some light, '\n"," 'and me close to her, I saw a moth crawl into her ear. I got scared, I—put '\n"," 'out my hand to do something, pluck it out, shake her, do something. She '\n"," 'didn’t exactly push me away. She looked up at me and raised her hand, '\n"," 'slowly—or it seemed to be slowly, but it was there before my hand was. She '\n"," 'just stood, still as a tree, waiting, and the moth came out again.” I didn’t '\n"," 'say anything. Not anything at all. We sat watching the western mountain. “I '\n"," 'went away,” said Grantham, his words stark and clear against the heat inside '\n"," 'him. “To get more specimens, you understand.” “Some more came,” I said. “I '\n"," 'was away for three months. A long time. Too long. Then I had no business '\n"," 'back in Kofa but I went back anyway—oh, in case I’d left anything there or '\n"," 'something. *1 was supposed to go back to the Institute, I guess. Mm. “The '\n"," 'first face I saw in Kofa that I knew was Miguel’s. I . fell over him. He was '\n"," 'standing like a brown statue on the duckboards near the saloon and I tripped '\n"," 'and knocked his hat off. I pulled him to his feet and asked him Com’ esta? '\n"," '“Malo, muy-jnalo and a flood of north-Mex is all I could get. I guess I '\n"," 'looked a little foolish. Why is it when you talk to someone who doesn’t know '\n"," 'your language, you holler at him? Finally I got impatient and ran him into '\n"," 'the bar. I asked Big Horn what Miguel was trying to tell me. 94 Theodore '\n"," 'Sturgeon “The general idea was that the little ones had died. I never did '\n"," 'find out how many, two or three. Miguel shrugged at this, took off his hat, '\n"," 'raised his eyes and his eyebrows, in that order, at the ceiling. I gather he '\n"," 'felt no responsibility over this; such matters were out of his hands, but '\n"," 'one could always make more. What bothered Miguel, Big Horn told me, was the '\n"," 'loss of his wife, who had broken her leg, gotten a bone infection, and died '\n"," 'muy rapido. She had been, it seemed, a very hard worker. “The girl? He '\n"," 'didn’t know. He didn’t know any more after I got excited and tried to shake '\n"," 'it out of him. Big Horn was over the bar with his bung-starter before I '\n"," 'could pull myself together. He never minded anybody getting rough at his bar '\n"," 'providing both parties were enjoying it. He pointed out to me that Miguel '\n"," 'had come in here peaceably .even if I hadn’t. Then he sat Miguel down and '\n"," 'questioned him quietly while I fumed, and then he told Miguel to go, which '\n"," 'he did much faster than usual. “ ‘He says,’ Big Horn told me, ‘that the girl '\n"," 'just wandered away. He says she always spent more nights out in the yucca '\n"," 'forest than home anyhow. She went away and she just didn’t come back. He '\n"," 'says he went looking for her, too, after the old lady died. I guess he '\n"," 'wanted his tortillas pounded. He looked real hard.’ “I told him thanks, and '\n"," 'came out here. I wish you had the makings, Chip.” “Sorry,” I said. “I came '\n"," 'out here and wandered for a while. A man can eat out here, sleep out here, '\n"," 'right time of year. You could, Chip, knowing it just from books. I guess I '\n"," 'felt real bad. Funny thing,” he mused. “I wanted to call her, but I had '\n"," 'never found out what her name was.” He was quiet. The evening breeze sprang '\n"," 'and died, stopped and pressed and sprang again. The yuccas whispered and '\n"," 'whispered. “Hear?” “I hear,” I sjiid. “I heard it one night, sleeping here, '\n"," 'and came up standing. There was no wind. She was here, right here, Chip. '\n"," 'Dancing like a yucca, whispering.” “See her?” “No, I didn’t see her.” I '\n"," 'couldn’t see his face, but I knew Cactus Dance 95 he was smiling, and I '\n"," 'wondered what in time he was smiling about. “You, Professor, you want '\n"," 'something more than you want anything else there is, more than money or your '\n"," 'name in books or a woman. You want that Pudley Chair in Botany. I bet you’d '\n"," 'kill anyone who tried to get it away from you.” “Anyone but you.” His '\n"," 'fringed shirt rustled as he twisted toward me. “You mean that. You do mean '\n"," 'that. That’s fine, Chip. That’s nice.” He rested his chin on his knees and '\n"," 'paid attention to the evening star. “Everybody wants some one single thing '\n"," 'that bad. Some get it, some don’t. Some know what it is, some never find '\n"," 'out. You found out. I found out.” “Want to tell me?” “Sure I do. Sure. Chip, '\n"," 'no offense, but you and I are different kinds of botanist.” “I know that. '\n"," 'But—well, go on.” “You want botany out of books. Some window-boxes, some '\n"," 'lab, sure. You learned it right; there’s not a thing wrong in being that '\n"," 'way, you see? Very valuable. You learned botany so’s you could be a '\n"," 'botanist, the best damn botanist in the world, if you could make it. You '\n"," 'might make it, too.” “And you?” “I got to be a botanist so I could be—close '\n"," 'to something. Something like that symbiosis you were talking about. Fm a '\n"," 'man, but man and cloverleaf, man and Chaya, man and pinon juniper—is that so '\n"," 'much crazier than moth and cactus?” “How close do you think you can carry '\n"," 'this symbiosis of yours? Or was it just a figure of speech?” “Time to show '\n"," 'you, I reckon,” he said. He rose. I followed. “It’s dark.” “Sure,” he said. '\n"," '“I know the way. Hook on to the back of my belt.” I did, and he strode off '\n"," 'purposefully into the pitch-black shadows of the yucca. How we turned, '\n"," 'climbed, slithered, I couldn’t say. It might have been a long way, and it '\n"," 'might have been a circle. We stopped. He fumbled in his pouch. “It’s her '\n"," 'birthday.” 96 Theodore Sturgeon “How do you know?” I whispered. This was a '\n"," 'place to whisper. “Just know. Pick a day, stay with it from then on. Amounts '\n"," 'to the same thing. Here.” He put something into my hand. Clqth, very fine '\n"," 'cloth. Layers, lace. Hard knob one end, two sticks other end . . . “A doll.” '\n"," '“Yup,” he said. “Purtiest one I ever saw.” He took it away from me. “Chip, '\n"," 'hush now. Wait till the wind dies.” I waited in the whispering dark. The '\n"," 'breeze was fitful, careless. It would drop to almost nothing, until all the '\n"," 'other breathings and stirrings could be heard, and then giggle on up to be a '\n"," 'breeze again. Suddenly, then, it was gone. From before us, in the pitch '\n"," 'blackness, a yucca whispered. “There she is,” Grantham murmured. He stepped '\n"," 'forward, and an unreasoning terror sent cold sweat oozing in my armpits. I '\n"," 'stepped after him. He was leaning forward, apparently putting the doll into '\n"," 'the lower swords of a young yucca. Something touched my face and I bit my '\n"," 'tongue. Then I realized that Grantham’s heavy hand had tilted the plant '\n"," 'toward us. Without conscious motivation I reached up swiftly and closed my '\n"," 'hand on a flower. Without conscious reasoning I was very careful to twist it '\n"," 'free without a sound or a detectible motion. I slipped it into my side '\n"," 'pocket. “ ’Bye, baby.” He stood up and nudged me. “Let’s go.” If anything, '\n"," 'the way back was longer. I stumbled along behind him, wondering if he were '\n"," 'sane enough to write that resignation coherently. When we reached the trail '\n"," 'a loom of silver was staining the eastern sky. “Easy going now,” was all he '\n"," 'said. We trudged into the rising moon. I was deeply disturbed, but Grantham '\n"," 'was calm and apparently deeply content. The yuccas thinned, and we started '\n"," 'up the valley’s throat. Abruptly Grantham grunted and stopped. “What is it?” '\n"," 'Silently he pointed. Fifty feet up the slope something wavered and flickered '\n"," 'in the moonlight. “Bless her heart,” he said. “Come on, Chip.” He struck off '\n"," 'toward whatever it was, and I followed him, walking on the balls of my feet, '\n"," 'my eyes too wide, so that they hurt. / • Cactus Dance 97 When. I caught up '\n"," 'with him he stopped, turned to me, and drew his knife. “Symbiosis, Chip.” I '\n"," 'don’t think he could see my face. I wouldn’t want to. He dropped to one knee '\n"," 'and I leapt backward, stood spraddled, gasping. I watched him digging '\n"," 'carefully in the ground, while over and around him fluttered a silent cloud '\n"," 'of small white moths. They were not yucca moths. I know they weren’t because '\n"," 'yucca moths never, never cluster near the ground. I mean, moths that cluster '\n"," 'that way are not yucca moths, they aren’t, they were not, they couldn’t be. '\n"," 'Look it up if you don’t believe it. Grantham grunted, pulled, and up out of '\n"," 'the ground came an object that looked like a large parsnip. “Ever see one of '\n"," 'these in the flesh, Chip?” Gingerly, I took it, squinted at it in the '\n"," 'brightening moonlight. It was like a tuber, spineless, and with the upper '\n"," 'end rounded and ribbed. I slipped my fingers along the grooves between the '\n"," 'ribs and felt the small round protuberances. “Lophophora,” I said. My voice '\n"," 'sounded odd to me. “I don’t know which one.” “Doesn’t matter.” He trimmed '\n"," 'off the grooved part and dropped it into his satchel. “Long as its peyotl, '\n"," 'who’s quibbling?” Back on the trail, I swallowed hard and asked, “That’s '\n"," 'symbiosis? You leave a doll on a yucca, and moths find peyotl for you?” He '\n"," 'laughed his big laugh. “You can’t see further than your nose,” he said gaily '\n"," 'and insultingly, “let alone as far as ybur front teeth.” “If you’ll '\n"," 'explain,” I said stiffly, “I shall listen.” “The doll’s a symbol,” he said, '\n"," 'suddenly deeply serious. “It represents something as vital as cellulose to a '\n"," 'bacterium, or bacterial products to a termite. I didn’t need to giye the '\n"," 'doll itself, except it was her birthday. Long as I bring what she needs—and '\n"," 'I do.” “And it—she—I mean, you get peyotl out of it,” I floundered. “That’s '\n"," 'no symbol. That’s cash money.” “It is? What do I do with the money? Well, '\n"," 'what?” “Grubstake,” I mumbled, frightened by his intensity. “I sell it for '\n"," 'just what I need, no more,” he said. “And with it I stay out here and—” he '\n"," 'chuckled—“study my references.” 98 Theodore Sturgeon At the saloon Grantham '\n"," 'wrote his resignation, and I was glad to see that it was written exactly as '\n"," 'the old Grantham would have done it. I tucked it away safely. We dined '\n"," 'heartily and slept in the same room back of the bar, and in the morning he- '\n"," 'helped me buy a horse. It was therefore not until I was out on the hot sand '\n"," 'again that I had a chance to study my specimen. I felt very good that '\n"," 'morning. I was, of course, sorry for poor mad Grantham. On the other '\n"," 'hand—what was the little white moth that clustered over peyotl at night? Not '\n"," 'the yucca moth, surely. Surely not. I wondered what had happened to that '\n"," 'strange, pathetic little girl. Wandered out in her blue polka-dot dress, to '\n"," 'die * among the yuccas, no doubt. I studied the wilted flower as I rode. '\n"," 'Poor Grantham! This was enough to tip any trained botanist over the edge '\n"," '—this freak, sport, mutant yucca. Who ever heard of a white yucca flower '\n"," 'with a large blue patch on each petal? THE COMEDIAN’S CHILDREN Prologue T he '\n"," 'quiet third of the Twenty-First Century came to an end at ten o’clock on the '\n"," 'morning of May 17, 2034, with the return to earth of a modified Fafnir space '\n"," 'cruiser under the command of Capt. Avery Swope. Perhaps in an earlidr or a '\n"," 'later day, the visitation which began on the above date might have had less '\n"," 'effect. But the earth was lulled and content with itself, and for good '\n"," 'reason—international rivalries having reverted to the football fields and '\n"," 'tennis courts, an intelligeftt balance of trade and redistribution of '\n"," 'agriculture and industry having been achieved. Captain Swope’s mission was '\n"," 'to accomplish the twelfth off-earth touchdown, and the body on which he '\n"," 'touched was Iapetus (sometimes Japetus), the remarkable eighth satellite of '\n"," 'Saturn. All Saturn’s satellites are remarkable, each for a different reason. '\n"," 'Iapetus’ claim to fame is his fluctuating brilliance; he always swings '\n"," 'brightly around the eastern limb of the ringed planet, and dwindles dimly '\n"," 'behind the western edge. Obviously the little moon is half bright and half '\n"," 'dark, and keeps one face turned always to its parent; but why should a moon '\n"," 'be half bright and half dark? It was an intriguing mystery, and it had '\n"," 'become the fashion to affect all sorts of decorations which mimicked the '\n"," 'fluctuations of the inconstant moonlet: cufflinks and tunic clasps which '\n"," 'dimmed and brightened, bread-wrappers and book-jackets in dichotomous '\n"," 'motley. Copies were reproduced of the midcentury master Pederson’s '\n"," 'magnificent oil painting of a space ship aground on one of Saturn’s moons, '\n"," 'with four suited figures alighting, and it became a. sort of colophon for '\n"," 'news stories about Swope’s achievement and window displays of bi-colored '\n"," 'gimcrackery—with every- 99 100 Theodore Sturgeon one marvelling at the '\n"," 'Twentieth Century artist’s unerring prediction of a Fafnir’s contours, and '\n"," 'no one noticing that the painting could not possibly have been of Iapetus, '\n"," 'which has no blue sky nor weathered rocks, but must certainly have been the '\n"," 'meticulous Pederson’s visualization of Titan. Still, everyone thought it was '\n"," 'Iapetus, and since it gave no evidence as to why Iapetus changed its '\n"," 'brightness, the public embraced the painting as the portrait of a mystery. '\n"," 'They told each other that Swope would find out. CaptainSwope found out, but '\n"," 'Captain Swope did not tell. Something happened to his Fafnir on Iapetus. His '\n"," 'signals were faintly heard through the roar of an electrical disturbance on '\n"," 'the parent world, and they were unreadable, and they were the last. Then, '\n"," 'voiceless, he returned, took up his braking orbit, and at last came '\n"," 'screaming down out of the black into and through the springtime blue. His '\n"," 'acquisition of the tail-down attitude so very high—over fifty miles—proved '\n"," 'that something was badly wrong. The extreme deliberation with which he came '\n"," 'in over White Sands, and the constant yawing, like that of a baseball bat '\n"," 'balanced on a fingertip, gave final proof that he was attempting a landing '\n"," 'under manual control, something never before attempted with anything the '\n"," 'size of a Fafnir. It was superbly done, and may never be equalled, that '\n"," 'roaring drift down and down through the miles, over ^forty-six of them, and '\n"," 'never a yaw that the sensitive hands could not compensate, until that last '\n"," 'one. What happened? Did some devil-imp of wind, scampering runt of a '\n"," 'hurricane, shoulder against the Fafnir? Or was the tension and strain at '\n"," 'last too much for weary muscles which could not, even for a split second, '\n"," 'relax and pass the controls to another pair of hands? Whatever it was, it '\n"," 'happened at three and six-tenths miles, and she lay over bellowing as her '\n"," 'pilot made a last desperate attempt to gain some altitude and perhaps '\n"," 'another try. She gained nothing, she lost a bit, hurtling like a dirigible '\n"," 'gone mad, faster and faster, hoping to kick the curve of the earth down and '\n"," 'away from her, until, over Arkansas, the forward section of the rocket '\n"," 'liner—the one which is mostly inside the ship—disintegrated and she blew off '\n"," 'her tail. She turned twice end over end and thundered into a buckwheat '\n"," 'field. The Comedian’s Children 101 Two days afterwards a photographer got a '\n"," 'miraculous picture. It was darkly whispered later that he had unforgivably '\n"," 'carried the child—the three-year-old Tresak girl from the farm two miles '\n"," 'away—into the crash area and had inexcusably posed her there; but this could '\n"," 'never be proved, and anyway, how could he have known? Nevertheless, the '\n"," 'multiple miracles of a momentary absence of anything at all in the wide '\n"," 'clear background, of the shadows which mantled her and of the glitter of the '\n"," 'many-sharded metal scrap which reared up behind her to give her a crown— but '\n"," 'most of all the miracle of the child herself, black-eyed, golden-haired, '\n"," 'trusting, fearless, one tender hand resting on some jagged steel which would '\n"," 'surely shred her flesh if she were less beautiful—these made one of the '\n"," 'decade’s most memorable pictures. In a day she was known to the nation, and '\n"," 'warmly loved as a sort of infant phoenix rising from the disaster of the '\n"," 'roaring bird; the death of the magnificent Swope could not cut the nation '\n"," 'quite as painfully because of her, as that cruel ruin could not cut her '\n"," 'hand. The news, then, that on the third day after her contact with the wreck '\n"," 'of the ship from Iapetus, the Tresak child had fallen ill of a disfiguring '\n"," 'malady never before seen on earth, struck the nation and the world a '\n"," 'dreadful and terrifying blow. At first there was only a numbness, but at the '\n"," 'appearance of the second, and immediately the third cases of the disease, '\n"," 'humanity sprang into action. The first thing it did was to pass seven Acts, '\n"," 'an Executive Order and three Conventions against any further off-earth '\n"," 'touchdowns; so, until the end of the iapetitis epidemic, there was an end to '\n"," 'all but orbital space flight. “You’re going to be all right,” she whispered, '\n"," 'and bent to kiss the solemn, comic little face. (They said it wasn’t '\n"," 'contagious; at least, adults didn’t get it.) She straightened up and smiled '\n"," 'at him, and Billy smiled his half-smile—it was the left half—in response. He '\n"," 'said something to her, but by now his words were so blurred that she failed '\n"," 'to catch them. She couldn’t bear to have him repeat whatever it was; he '\n"," 'seemed always so puzzled when people did not understand him, as if he could '\n"," 'hear himself quite plainly. So to spare herself the pathetic pucker which '\n"," 'would worry the dark half of his face, she only smiled the more and 102 '\n"," 'Theodore Sturgeon said again, “You’re going to be all right,” and then she '\n"," 'fled. Outside in the corridor she leaned for a moment against the wall and '\n"," 'got rid of the smile, the rigid difficult hypocrisy of that smile. There was '\n"," 'something standing there on the other side of the scalding blur which '\n"," 'replaced the smile; she said, because she had to say it to someone just '\n"," 'then: “How could I promise him tjiat?” “One does,” said the man, answering. '\n"," 'She shook away the blur and saw that it was Dr. Otis. “I promised him the '\n"," 'same thing myself. One just . . . does,” he shrugged. “Heri Gonza promises '\n"," 'them, -too.” “I saw that,” she nodded. “He seems to wonder ‘How could I?’ '\n"," 'too.” “He does what he can,” said the doctor, indicating, with a motion of '\n"," 'his head, the special hospital wing in which they stood, the row of doors '\n"," 'behind and beyond, doors to laboratories, doors to research and computer '\n"," 'rooms, store rooms, staff rooms, all donated by the comedian. “In a way he '\n"," 'has more right to make a promise like that than Billy’s doctor.” “Or Billy’s '\n"," 'sister,” she agreed tremulously. She turned to walk down the corridor, and '\n"," 'the doctor walked with her. “Any new cases?” “Two.” She shuddered. “Any—” '\n"," '“No,” he said quickly, “no deaths.” And as if to change the subject, he '\n"," 'said, “I understand you’re to be congratulated.” “What? Oh,” she said '\n"," 'wreching her mind away from the image of Billy’s face, half marble, half '\n"," 'mobile mahogany. “Oh, the award. Yes, they called me this afternoon. Thank '\n"," 'you. Somehow it . . . doesn’t mean very much right now.” They stood before '\n"," 'his office at the head of the corridor. “I think I understand how you feel,” '\n"," 'he said. “You’d trade it in a minute for—” he nodded down the corridor '\n"," 'toward the boy’s room. “I’d even trade it for a reasonable hope,” she '\n"," 'agreed. “Good night, doctor. You’ll call me?” “I’ll call you if anything '\n"," 'happens. Including anything good. Don’t forget that, will you? I’d hate to '\n"," 'have you afraid of the sound of my voice.” “Thank you, Doctor.” The '\n"," 'Comedian’s Children 103 “Stay away from the trideo this once. You need some '\n"," 'sleep.” “Oh Lord. Tonight’s the big effort,” she remembered. “Stay away from '\n"," 'it,” he said with warm severity. “You don’t need to be reminded of '\n"," 'iapetitis, or be persuaded to help.” “You sound like Dr. Horowitz.” His '\n"," 'smile clicked off. She had meant it as a mild pleasantry; if she had been '\n"," 'less tired, less distraught, she would have had better sense. Better taste. '\n"," 'Horowitz’ name echoed in these of all halls like a blasphemy. Once honored '\n"," 'as among the greatest of medical researchers, he had inexplicably turned his '\n"," 'back on Heri Gonza and his Foundation, had flatly refused research grants, '\n"," 'and had publicly insulted the comedian and his great philanthropy. As a '\n"," 'result he had lost his reappointment to the directorship of the Research '\n"," 'Institute and a good deal of his professional standing. And like the sullen '\n"," 'buffoon he was, he plunged into research—“real research,” he inexcusably '\n"," 'called it—on iapetitis, attempting single-handedly not only to duplicate the '\n"," 'work of the Foundation, but to surpass it: “the only way I know,” he had '\n"," 'told a reporter, “to pull the pasture out from under that clod and his '\n"," 'trained sheep.” Heri Gonza’s reply was typical: by deft sketches on his '\n"," 'programs, he turned Horowitz into an improper noun, defining a horo-witz as '\n"," 'a sort of sad sack or poor soul, pathetic, mildly despicable, incompetent '\n"," 'and always funny—the kind of subhuman who not only asks for, but justly '\n"," 'deserves a pie in the face. He backed this up with a widely publicized '\n"," 'standing off to Dr. Horowitz of a no-strings-attached research grant of half '\n"," 'a million; which Dr. Horowitz, after his first unprintable refusal (his '\n"," 'instructions to the comedian as to what he could do with the money were '\n"," 'preceded by the suggestion that he first change it into pennies), ignored. '\n"," 'Therefore the remark, even by a Nobel prizewinner, even by a reasonably '\n"," 'handsome woman understandably weary and upset, even by one whose young '\n"," 'brother lay helpless in the disfiguring grip of an incurable disease—such a '\n"," 'remark could hardly be forgiven, especially when made to the head of the '\n"," 'Iapetitis Wing of the Medical Center and local chairman of the Foundation. '\n"," '“I’m sorry, Dr. Ofis,” she said. “I . . . probably need sleep more than I '\n"," 'realized.” 104 Theodore Sturgeon “You probably do, Dr. Barran,” he said '\n"," 'evenly, and went into his office and closed the door. “Damn,” said Iris '\n"," 'Barran, and went home. No one knew precisely how Heri Gonza had run across '\n"," 'the idea of an endurance contest cum public solicitation of funds, or when '\n"," 'he decided to include it in his bag of tricks. He did not invent the idea; '\n"," 'it was a phenomenon of early broadcasting, which erupted briefly on the '\n"," 'marriage of video with audio in a primitive device known as television. The '\n"," 'performances, consisting of up to forty continuous hours of entertainment '\n"," 'interspersed with pleas for aid in one charity or another, were headed by a '\n"," 'single celebrity who acted as master of ceremonies and beggar-in-chief. The '\n"," 'terminologically bastardized name for this production was telethon, from the '\n"," 'Greek root tele, to carry, and the syllable thon, meaningless in itself but '\n"," 'actually the last syllable of the word marathon. The telethon, sensational '\n"," 'at first, had rapidly deteriorated, due to its use by numbers of greedy '\n"," 'publicists who, for the price of a phone call, could get large helpings of '\n"," 'publicity by pledging donations which, in many cases, they failed to make, '\n"," 'and the large percentage of the citizenry whose impulse to give did not '\n"," 'survive their telephoned promises. And besides, the novelty passed, the '\n"," 'public no longer watched. So for nearly eighty years there were no '\n"," 'telethons, and if there had been, a disease to hang on would have been hard '\n"," 'to find. Heart disease, cancer, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy— '\n"," 'these, and certain other infirmities on which public appeals had been based, '\n"," 'had long since disappeared or were negligibly present. < Now, however, there '\n"," 'was iapetitis. A disorder of the midbrain and central nervous ssytem, it '\n"," 'attacked children between the ages of three and seven, affecting only one '\n"," 'hemisphere, with no statistical preference for either side. Its mental '\n"," 'effects were slight (which in its way was one of the most tragic aspects of '\n"," 'the disease) being limited to aphasia and sometimes a partial alexia. It had '\n"," 'more drastic effects on the motor system, however, and on the entire '\n"," 'cellular regeneration mechanisms of the affected side, which would gradually '\n"," 'solidify and become inert, immobile. The most spectacular symptom was on the '\n"," 'super- The Comedian’s Children 105 ficial pigmentation. The immobilized sMe '\n"," 'turned white as bleached bone, the other increasingly dark, beginning with a '\n"," 'reddening and slowly going through the red-browns to a chocolate in the '\n"," 'latter stages. The division was exactly on the median line, and the '\n"," 'bicoloration proceeded the same way in all cases, regardless of the original '\n"," 'pigmentation. There was no known cure. There was no known treatment. There '\n"," 'was only the Foundation—Heri Gonza’s Foundation—and all it could do was '\n"," 'install expensive equipment and expensive people to operate it . . . and '\n"," 'hope. There was nothing anyone else could do which would not merely '\n"," 'duplicate Foundations efforts, and besides, with one exception the '\n"," 'Foundation already had the top people in microbiology, neurology, virology, '\n"," 'internal medicine, and virtually every other discipline which might have '\n"," 'some bearing on the disease. There were, so far, only 376 known cases, every '\n"," 'one of which was in a Foundation hospital. Heri Gonza had been associated '\n"," 'with the disease since the very beginning, when he visited a children’s '\n"," 'hospital and saw the appalling appearance of the first case, little Linda '\n"," 'Tresak of Arkansas. When four more cases appeared in the Arkansas State '\n"," 'Hospital after she was a patient there for some months, Heri Gonza moved '\n"," 'with characteristic noise and velocity. Within forty-eight hours of his '\n"," 'first knowledge of the new cases, all -five were ensconced in a specially '\n"," 'vacated wing of the Medical Center, and mobilization plans were distributed '\n"," 'to centers all over the world, so that new clinics could be set up and '\n"," 'duplicate facilities installed the instant the disease showed up. There were '\n"," 'at present forty-two such clinics. Each child had been picked up within '\n"," 'hours of the first appearance of symptoms, whisked to the hospital, '\n"," 'pampered, petted, and . . . observed. No treatment. No cure. The white got '\n"," 'whiter the dark got darker the white side slowly immobilized, the dark side '\n"," 'grew darker but was otherwise unaffected; the speech difficulty grew '\n"," 'steadily fbut extremely slowly) worse; the prognosis was always negative. '\n"," 'Negative by extrapolation: any organism in the throes of such deterioration '\n"," 'might survive for a long time, but must ultimately succumb. In a peaceful '\n"," 'world, with economy stabilized, population growing but not running wild any '\n"," 'longer, iapetitis was big news. The biggest. 106 Theodore Sturgeon The '\n"," 'telethon was, unlike its forbears, not aimed at the public pocket. It was to '\n"," 'serve rather as a whip to an already aware world, information to the '\n"," 'informed, aimed at earlier and earlier discovery and diagnosis. It was one '\n"," 'of the few directions left to medical research. The disease was obviously '\n"," 'contagious, but its transmission method was unknown. Some child, somewhere, '\n"," 'might be found early enough to display some signs of the point of entry of '\n"," 'the disease, something like a fleabite in spotted fever, the mosquito '\n"," 'puncture in malaria—some sign which might heal or disappear soon after its '\n"," 'occurrence. A faint hope, but it was a hope, and there was little enough of '\n"," 'that around. So, before a wide grey backdrop bearing a forty-foot insigne in '\n"," 'the center, the head and shoulders of a crying child vividly done in half '\n"," 'silver, half mahogany, Heri Gonza opened his telethon. Iris Barran got home '\n"," 'well after it had started; she had rather overstayed her hospital visit. She '\n"," 'came in wearily and slumped on the divan, thinking detachedly of Billy, '\n"," 'thinking of Dr. Otis. The thought of the doctor reminded her of her affront '\n"," 'to him, and she felt a flash of annoyance, first at herself for having done '\n"," 'it, and immediately another directed at him for being so touchy—and so '\n"," 'unforgiving. At the same time she recalled his advice to get some sleep, not '\n"," 'to watch the telethon; and in a sudden, almost childish burst of rebellion '\n"," 'she slapped the arm of the divan and brought the trideo to life. The '\n"," 'opposite wall of the room, twelve feet high, thirty feet long, seemed '\n"," 'ta~turn to smoke, which cleared to reveal an apparent extension of the floor '\n"," 'of the room, back and further back, to Heri Gonza’s great grey backdrop. All '\n"," 'around were the sounds, the smells, the pressure of the presence of '\n"," 'thousands of massed, rapt people. “. . . so I looked down and there the '\n"," 'horse had caught its silly hoof in my silly stirrup. ‘Horse,’ I says, ‘if '\n"," 'you’re gettin’ on, I’m gettin’ off!’ ” The laugh was a great soft booming '\n"," 'explosion, as usual out of all proportion to the quality of the witticism. '\n"," 'Heri Gonza had that rarest of comic skills, the ability to pyramid his '\n"," 'effects, so that the mildest of them seemed much funnier than it really was. '\n"," 'It was mounted on a rapidly-stacked structure of previous quips and jokes, '\n"," 'each with its little store of merriment and all merriment suppressed by the '\n"," 'audience The Comedian’s Children 107 for fear of missing not only the next '\n"," 'joke, but the entire continuity. When the pyramid was capped, the release '\n"," 'was explosive. And yet in that split instant between capper and explosion, '\n"," 'he always managed to slip in a clear three or four syllables, “On my way '\n"," 'here—” or “When the president—” or “Like the horowitz who—” which, repeated '\n"," 'and completed after the big laugh, turned out to be the base brick for the '\n"," 'next pyramid. Watching his face during the big laughs—yocks, the '\n"," 'knowledgeable columnists and critics called them—had become a national '\n"," 'pastime. Though the contagion of laughter was in his voice and choice of '\n"," 'phrase, he played everything deadpan. A small, wiry man with swift nervous '\n"," 'movements, he had a f ace-by-the-million: anybody’s face. Its notable '\n"," 'characteristics were three: thin lips, masked eyes, impenetrable as onyx, '\n"," 'and astonishing jug-handle ears. His voice was totally flexible, capable of '\n"," 'almost any timbre, and with the falsetto he frequently affected, his. range '\n"," 'was slightly over four octaves. He was an accomplished ventriloquist, though '\n"," 'he never used the talent with the conventional dummy, but rather to '\n"," 'interrupt himself with strange voices. But it was his ordinary, '\n"," 'unremarkable, almost immobile face which was his audience’s preoccupation. '\n"," 'His face never laughed, though in dialogue his voice might. His voice could '\n"," 'smile, too, even weep, and his face did not. But at the yock, if it was a '\n"," 'big yock, a long one, his frozen waiting face would twitch; the thin lips '\n"," 'would fill out a trifle: he’s going to smile, he’s going to smile! '\n"," 'Sometimes, when the yock was especially fulsome, his mouth actually would '\n"," 'widen a trifle; but then it was always time to go on, and, deadpan, he '\n"," 'would. What could it matter to anyone whether or not one man in the world '\n"," 'smiled? On the face of it, nothing: yet millions of people, most of whom '\n"," 'were unaware of it, bent close to their trideo walls and peered raptly, '\n"," 'waiting, waiting to see him smile. As a result, everyone who heard him, '\n"," 'heard every word. Iris found herself grateful, somehow—able to get right out '\n"," 'of herself, sweep in with that vast unseen crowd and leave herself, her '\n"," 'worrying self, her angry, wfeary, logical, Nobel-prizewinning self asprawl '\n"," 'on the divan while she hung on and smiled, hung on and tittered, hung on and '\n"," 'exploded with the world. He built, and he built, and the trideo cameras '\n"," 'crept in on 108 Theodore Sturgeon him until, before she knew it, he was '\n"," 'standing as close to the invisible wall as belief would permit; and still he '\n"," 'came closer, so that he seemed in the room with her; and this was a pyramid '\n"," 'higher than most, more swiftly and more deftly built, so that the ultimate '\n"," 'explosion could contain itself not much longer, not a beat, not a second. . '\n"," '. . And he stopped in mid-sentence, mid-word, even, and, over at the left, '\n"," 'fell to one knee and held out his arms to the right. “Come on, honey,” he '\n"," 'said in a gentle, tear-checked purr. From the right came a little girl, '\n"," 'skipping. She was a beautiful little girl, a picture-book little girl, with '\n"," 'old-fashioned bouncing curls, shiny black patent-leather shoes with straps, '\n"," 'little white socks, a pale-blue dress with a very wide, very short skirt. '\n"," 'But she wasn’t skipping, she was limping. She almost fell, and Heri was '\n"," 'there to catch her. Holding her in his arms, while she looked trustingly up '\n"," 'into his face, he walked to center stage, turned, faced the audience. His '\n"," 'eyes were on her face; when he raised them abruptly to the audience, they '\n"," 'were, by some trick of the light (or of Heri Gonza) unnaturally bright. And '\n"," 'he stood, that’s all he did, for a time, stood there with the child in his '\n"," 'arms, while the pent-up laughter turned to frustrated annoyance, directed '\n"," 'first at the comedian, and slowly, slowly, with a rustle of sighs, at the '\n"," 'audience itself by the audience. Ah, to see such a thing and be full of '\n"," 'laughter: how awful I am. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. One little arm was white, '\n"," 'one pink. Between the too-tiny socks and the too-short skirt, the long thin '\n"," 'legs were one white, one pink. “This is little Koska,” he said after an age. '\n"," 'The child smiled suddenly at the sound of her name. He shifted her in his '\n"," 'elbow so he could stroke her hair. He said softly, “She’s a little Esthonian '\n"," 'girl, from the far north. She doesn’t speak very much English, so she won’t '\n"," 'mind if we talk about her.” A huskiness crept into his voice. “She came to '\n"," 'us only yesterday. Her mother is a good woman. She sent her to us the minute '\n"," 'she noticed.” Silence again, then he turned the child so their faces were '\n"," 'side by side, looking straight into the audience. It was hard to see at '\n"," 'first, and then it became all too plain—the excessive The Comedian’s '\n"," 'Children 109 pallor of the right side of her face, the too-even flush on the '\n"," 'left, and the sharp division between them down the center. “We’ll make you '\n"," 'better,” he whispered. He said it again in a foreign language, and the child '\n"," 'brightened, smiled trustingly into his face, kept her smile as she faced the '\n"," 'audience again: and wasn’t the smile a tiny bit wider on the pink side than '\n"," 'on the white? You couldn’t tell . . . “Help me,” said Heri Gonza. “Help her, '\n"," 'and the others, help us. Find these children, wherever in the world they '\n"," 'might be, and call us. Pick up any telephone in the world and say simply, I '\n"," '. . . F. That’s IF, the Iapetitis Foundation. We treat them like little '\n"," 'kings and queens. We never cause them any distress. By trideo they are in '\n"," 'constant touch with their loved ones.” Suddenly, his voice rang. “The call '\n"," 'you make may find the child who teaches us what we need to know. Your '\n"," 'call—yours!—may find the cure for us.” He knelt and set the child gently on '\n"," 'her feet. He knelt holding her hands, looking into her face. He said, “And '\n"," 'whoever you are, wherever you might be, you doctors, researchers, students, '\n"," 'teachers ... if anyone, anywhere, has an inkling, an idea, a way to help, '\n"," 'any way at all—then call me. Call me now, call here—” He pointed upward and '\n"," 'the block letters and figures of the local telephone floated over his '\n"," 'head—“and tell me. I’ll answer you now, I’ll personally speak to anyone who '\n"," 'can help. Help, oh, help.” The last word rang and rang in the air. The deep '\n"," 'stage behind him slowly darkened, leaving the two figures, the kneeling man '\n"," 'and the little golden girl, flooded with light. He released her hands and '\n"," 'she turned away from him, smiling timidly, and crossed the wide stage. It '\n"," 'seemed to take forever, and as she walked, very slightly she dragged her '\n"," 'left foot. v When she was gone, there was nothing left to look at but Heri '\n"," 'Gonza. He had not moved, but the lights had changed, making of him a '\n"," 'luminous silhouette against the endless black behind him . . . one kneeling '\n"," 'man, a light in the universal dark . . . hope . . . slowly fading, but '\n"," 'there, still there . . . no? Oh, there . . . A sound of singing, the palest '\n"," 'of pale blue stains in deep center. The singing up, a powerful voice from '\n"," 'the past, an ancient, all but forgotten tape of one of the most moving '\n"," 'renditions the world has ever known, especially for such a 110 Theodore '\n"," 'Sturgeon moment as this: Mahalia Jackson singing The Lord’s Prayer, with the '\n"," 'benefit of such audio as had not been dreamed of in her day . . . with a '\n"," 'cool fresh scent, with inaudible quasihypnotic emanations, with a whispering '\n"," 'chorus a chorus of angels might learn from. Heri Gonza Jiad not said “Let us '\n"," 'pray.” He would never do such a thing, not on a global network. There was '\n"," 'just the kneeling dimness, and the blue glow far away in the black. And if '\n"," 'at the very end the glow looked to some like the sign of the cross, it might '\n"," 'have been only a shrouded figure raising its arms; and if this was '\n"," 'benediction, surely it was in the eye of the beholder. Whatever it was, no '\n"," 'one who saw it completely escaped its spell, or ever forgot it. Iris Barran, '\n"," 'for one, exhausted to begin with, heart and mind full to bursting with the '\n"," 'tragedy of iapetitis; Iris Barran was wrung out by the spectacle. All she '\n"," 'could think of was the last spoken word: Help! She sprang to her phone and '\n"," 'waved it active. With trembling fingers she dialed the number which floated '\n"," 'in her mind as it had on the trideo wall, and to the composed young lady who '\n"," 'appeared in her solido cave, saying, “Trideo, C. A. O. Good evening,” she '\n"," 'gasped, “Heri Gonza—quickly.” “One moment please,” said the vision, and '\n"," 'disappeared, to be replaced instantly by another, even more composed, even '\n"," 'lovelier, who said, “I.F. Telethon.” “Heri Gonza.” “Yes, of course. Your '\n"," 'name?” “I-Iris Barran. Dr. Iris Barran.” The girl looked up sharply. “Not '\n"," 'the—” “Yes, I won the Nobel prize. Please—let me speak to Heri Gonza.” “One '\n"," 'moment please.” The next one was a young man with curly hair, a bell-like '\n"," 'baritone, and anintensely interested face. He was Burcke of the network. He '\n"," 'passed her to a jovial little fat man with shrewd eyes who was with '\n"," 'Continuity Acceptance. Iris could have screamed out loud. But a worldwide '\n"," 'appeal for calls would jam lines and channels for hours, and obviously a '\n"," 'thorough screening process was essential. She was dimly aware that her name '\n"," 'and face, only today in all the news, had already carried her to the top. '\n"," 'Consciously, she thought of none of this; she held on and drove, wanting '\n"," 'only to help . . . The Comedian’s Children 111 help ... A snatch of the '\n"," 'conversation she had had with Dr. Otis drifted across her mind: I guests '\n"," 'you’d trade it for . . . and then a heart-rending picture of Billy’s face, '\n"," 'trying to smile with half a mouth. I’d trade it all for a reasonable hope . '\n"," '. . and suddenly she was staring into the face of Heri Gonza. Reflexively '\n"," 'she glanced over her shoulder at the trideo wall; Heri Gonza was there too, '\n"," 'with a solidophone pillar in center stage, its back to the audience so that '\n"," 'only the comedian could see its cave. Light from it flickered on his face. '\n"," '“I’d know that face anywhere!” he said raspingly. “Oh,” she said faintly, '\n"," '“Mr. . . . uh . . .” and then remembered that one of his public affectations '\n"," 'was never to permit anyone to call him Mister. She said, “Heri Gonza, I . . '\n"," '. I’m Iris B-barran, and I—” She realized that her voice could not be heard '\n"," 'over the trideo. She was grateful for that. He said, just as stridently, “I '\n"," 'know who you are. I know the story of your life too.” Switching to a comic '\n"," 'quack, he said, “So-o-o?” “You know I just won the Nobel award. M—uh, Heri '\n"," 'Gonza, I want to help, more than anything in the world, I want to help. My '\n"," 'brother has it. W-would you like me to give the award money to you ... I '\n"," 'mean, to the Foundation?” She did not know what she expected in exchange for '\n"," 'this • stunning offer. She had not thought that far ahead. What she did not '\n"," 'expect was ...  “You what?” he yelled, so loud she drew her head down, '\n"," 'gracelessly, turtle-like. “Listen, you, I got along without you before and I '\n"," 'can get along without you now. You’re getting from me, see, and I’m giving. '\n"," 'What you got I don’t want. I’m not up here to do you no good. I tell you '\n"," 'what you got, you got a wrong number, and you are, s-s-s-s-so,” he hissed in '\n"," 'a hilarious flatulent stutter, “s-s-so long.” And before she could utter '\n"," 'another sound he waved her off and her phone cave went black. , Numb with '\n"," 'shock, she slowly turned to the trideo wall, where Heri Gonza was striding '\n"," 'downstage to the audience. His expressionless face, his gait, his posture, '\n"," 'the inclination of his head, and his tone of voice all added to an amused '\n"," 'indignation, with perhaps a shade more anger than mirth. He tossed a thumb '\n"," 'at the phone and said, “Wits we got calling, can you imagine? At a time like '\n"," 'this. We got dimwits, half wits, and—” exactly the right pause; there was '\n"," 'one bleat 112 Theodore Sturgeon of laughter somewhere in the audience and '\n"," 'then a thousand voices to chorus with him—“horowitz!” Iris sank back in the '\n"," 'phone chair and covered her face, pressing so hard against her tired eyes '\n"," 'that she saw red speckles. For a time she was shocked completely beyond '\n"," 'thought, but at last she was able to move. She rose heavily and went to the '\n"," 'divan, arrested her hand as she was about to click off the trideo. Heri '\n"," 'Gonza was back at the stage phone, talking eagerly to someone, his voice '\n"," 'honey and gentleness. “Oh bless you, brother, and thank you. You may have an '\n"," 'idea there, so I tell you what you do. You call the LF. at Johannesburg and '\n"," 'arrange a meeting with the doctors there. They’ll listen ... No, brother, '\n"," 'collect of course. What’s-amatta, brother, you broke? I got news for you, '\n"," 'for you-ee are-ee a-ee good-ee man-ee yes-ee indeedy-dee: you ain’ta broka '\n"," 'no mo. A man like you? I got a boy on the way this very minute with a bag o’ '\n"," 'gold for the likes of you brother . . . Oh now, don’t say thanks, you mak-a '\n"," 'me mad. ’Bye.” He waved off, and turned to the audience to intone, “A man '\n"," 'with an idea—little one, big one, who knows? But it’s to help ... so bless '\n"," 'him.” Thunderous applause. Iris let her hand finish the gesture and switched '\n"," 'off. She went and washed her face, and that gave her strength enough to '\n"," 'shower and change. After that she could think almost normally. How could he? '\n"," '__ , She turned over impossible alternatives, explanations. His phone was a '\n"," 'dummy: he couldn’t see her, didn’t know who was on the phone. Or: it was his '\n"," 'way of being funny, and she was too tired to understand. Or ... or ... it '\n"," 'was no ’ use: it had really happened, he had known what he was doing, he had '\n"," 'a reason. But what reason? Why? Why? In her mind she again heard that roar '\n"," 'from the audience: Horowitz. With difficulty, because it still stung, she '\n"," 'pieced together the conversation and then, moving her forefinger toward her '\n"," 'phone and the trideo, back and forth, puzzled out what had gone out over the '\n"," 'air and what had not. Only then did she fully understand that Heri Gonza had '\n"," 'done what he had done to make it seem that his first call was from Dr. '\n"," 'Horowitz. But if he needed that particular gag at that The Comedian’s '\n"," 'Children 113 time, why didn’t he fake it to a dead phone? Why actually '\n"," 'converse with her, cut her down like that? And he hadn’t let her help. That '\n"," 'was worse than any of the rudeness, the insult. He wouldn’t let her help. '\n"," 'What to do? Making the gesture she had made had not been hard; having it '\n"," 'refused was more than she could bear. She must help; she would help. Now of '\n"," 'all times, with all this useless money coming to her; she didn’t need it, '\n"," 'and it might, it just might somehow help, and bring Billy back home. Well '\n"," 'then, expose Heri Gonza. Give him back some of his own humiliation. Call in '\n"," 'the newsmen, make a statement. Tell them what she had offered, tell them '\n"," 'just who was on the line. He’d have to take the money, and apologize to '\n"," 'boot. She stood up; she sat down again. No. He had known what he was doing. '\n"," 'He had known who she was; he must have a telltale on his phone to get '\n"," 'information on his callers from that screening committee. She knew a lot '\n"," 'about Heri Gonza. He seemed so wild, so impulsive; he was not. He ran his '\n"," 'many enterprises with a steel fist; he took care of his own money, his own '\n"," 'bookings. He did not make mistakes nor take chances. He had refused her and '\n"," 'the Foundation would refuse her: the Foundation was Heri Gonza. He had his '\n"," 'reasons, and if she had any defense at all against what he had done, he '\n"," 'would not have done it. She wasn’t allowed to help. Unless—  She suddenly '\n"," 'ran to the phone. She dialled 5, and the cave lit up with the floating word '\n"," 'DIRECTORY. She dialled H, O, R, and touched the Slow button until she had '\n"," 'the Horowitzes. There were pathetically few of them. Almost everyone named '\n"," 'Horowitz had filed unlisted numbers: many had gone so far as to change their '\n"," 'names. George Rehoboth Horowitz, she remembered. He wasn’t listed. She '\n"," 'dialled Information and asked. The girl gave her a pitying smile and told '\n"," 'her the line was unlisted. And of course, it would be. If Dr. Horowitz '\n"," 'wasn’t the most hated man on earth, he was the next thing to it. A listed '\n"," 'phone would be useless to him, never silent. “Has he screening service?” '\n"," 'Iris asked suddenly. “He has,” said the girl, company-polite as always, but '\n"," 'now 114 Theodore Sturgeon utterly cold. Anyone who knew that creature to '\n"," 'speak to . . . “Your name, please?’’ , Iris told her, and added, “Please '\n"," 'tell him it’s very important.” The cave went dark but for the slowly '\n"," 'rotating symbol of the phone company, indicating that the operator was doing '\n"," 'her job. Then a man’s head appeared and looked her over for a moment, and '\n"," 'then said, “Dr. Barran?” “Dr. Horowitz.” She had not been aware of having '\n"," 'formed any idea of the famous (infamous?) Horowitz; yet she must have. His '\n"," 'face seemed too gentle to have issued those harsh rejoinders which the news '\n"," 'attributed to him; yet perhaps it was gentle enough to be taken for the '\n"," 'fumbler, the fool so many people thought he was. His eyes, in some '\n"," 'inexplicable way, assured her that his could not be clumsy hands. He wore '\n"," 'old-fashioned exterior spectacles; he was losing his hair; he was younger '\n"," 'than she had thought, and he was ugly. Crags are ugly, tree-trunks, the '\n"," 'hawk’s pounce, the bear’s foot, if beauty to you is all straight lines and '\n"," 'silk. Iris Barran was not repulsed by this kind of ugliness. She said, '\n"," 'bluntly, “Are you doing any good with the disease?” She did not specify: '\n"," 'today, there was only one disease. He said, in an odd way as if he had known '\n"," 'her for a long time and could judge how much she would understand, “I have '\n"," 'it all from the top down to the middle, and from the bottom up to about a '\n"," 'third. In between—nothing, and no way to get anything.” “Can you go any '\n"," 'further?” “I don’t know,” he said candidly. “I can go on trying to find ways '\n"," 'to go further, and if I find a way, I can try to move along on it.” “Would '\n"," 'some money help?” “It depends on whose it us.” “Mine.” He did not speak, but '\n"," 'tilted his head a little to one side and looked at her. She said, “I won ... '\n"," 'I have some money coming in. A good deal of it.” “I heard,” he said, and '\n"," 'smiled. He seemed to have very strong teeth, not white, not even, just '\n"," 'spotless and perfect. The Comedian’s Children 115 “It’s a good deal out of '\n"," 'my field, your theoretical physics, and I don’t understand it. I’m glad you '\n"," 'got it. I really am. You earned it.” She shook her head, denying it, and '\n"," 'said, “I was surprised.” “You shouldn’t have been. After ninety years of '\n"," 'rather frightening confusion, you’ve restored the concept of parity to '\n"," 'science—” he chuckled— “though hardly in the way anyone anticipated.” She '\n"," 'had not known that this was her accomplishment; she had never thought of it '\n"," 'in those terms. Her demonstration of gravitic flux was a subtle matter to be '\n"," 'communicated with wordless symbols, quite past speech. Even to herself she '\n"," 'had never made a conversational analog of it; this man had, though, not only '\n"," 'easily, but quite accurately. She thought, if this isn’t his field, and he '\n"," 'grasps it like that— just how good must he bp in his own? She said, “Can you '\n"," 'use the money? Will it help?” “God,” he said devoutly, “can I use it. . . . '\n"," 'As to whether it will help, Doctor, I can’t answer that. It would help me go '\n"," 'on. It may not make me arrive. Why did you think of me?” Would it hurt him '\n"," 'to know? she asked herself, and answered, it would hurt him if I were not '\n"," 'honest. She said, “I offered it—to the Foundation. They wouldn’t touch it. I '\n"," 'don’t know why.” “I do,” he said, and instantly held up his hand. “Not now,” '\n"," 'he said, checking her question. He reached somewhere off-transmission and '\n"," 'came up with a card, on which was lettered, AUDIO TAPPED. “Who—” “The '\n"," 'world,” he overrode her, “is full of clever amateurs. Tell me, why are you '\n"," 'willing to make such a sacrifice?” “Oh—the money. It isn’t a sacrifice. I '\n"," 'have enough: I don’t need it. And—my baby brother. He has it.” “U didn’t '\n"," 'know,” he said, with compassion. He made a motion with his hands. She did '\n"," 'not understand. “What?” He shook his head, touched his lips, and repeated '\n"," 'the motion, beckbning, at himself and the room behind him. Oh. Come where I '\n"," 'am. She nodded, but said only, “It’s been a great pleasure talking with you. '\n"," 'Perhaps I’ll see you soon.” He turned over his card; obviously he had used '\n"," 'it many times before. It was a map of a section of the city. She 116 '\n"," 'Theodore Sturgeon recognized it readily, followed his pointing finger, and '\n"," 'nodded eagerly. He said, “I hope it is soon.” She nodded again and rose, to '\n"," 'indicate that she was on her way. He smiled and waved off. It was like a '\n"," 'deserted city, or a decimated one; almost everyone was off the streets, '\n"," 'watching the telethon. The few people who were about all hurried, as if they '\n"," 'were out against their wills and anxious to get back and miss as little as '\n"," 'possible. It was known that he intended to go on for at least thirty-six '\n"," 'hours, and still they didn’t want to miss a minute of him. Wonderful, '\n"," 'wonderful, she thought, amazed (not for the first time) at people—just '\n"," 'people. Someone had once told her that she was in mathematics because she '\n"," 'was so apart from, amazed at, people. It was possible. She was, she knew, '\n"," 'very unskilled with people, and she preferred the company of mathematics, '\n"," 'which tried so hard to be reasonable, and to say what was really meant . . . '\n"," 'She easily found the sporting-goods store he had pointed out on his map, and '\n"," 'stepped into the darkened entrance. She looked carefully around and saw no '\n"," 'one, then tried the door. It was locked, and she experienced a flash of '\n"," 'disappointment of an intensity that surprised her. But even as she felt it, '\n"," 'she heard a faint click, tried the door again, and felt it open. She slid '\n"," 'inside and closed it, and was gratified to hear it lock again behind her. '\n"," 'Straight ahead a dim, concealed light flickered, enough to-show her that '\n"," 'there was a clear aisle straight back through the store. When she was almost '\n"," 'to the rear wall, the light flickered again, to show her a door at her '\n"," 'right, deep in an ell. It clicked as she approached, and opened without '\n"," 'trouble. She mounted two flights of stairs, and on the top landing stood '\n"," 'Horowitz, his hands out. She took them gladly, and for a wordless moment '\n"," 'they stood like that, laughing silently, until he released one of her hands '\n"," 'and drew her into his place. He closed the door carefully and then turned '\n"," 'and leaned against it. “Well!” he said. “I’m sorry about the cloak and '\n"," 'dagger business.” “It was very exciting.” She smiled. “Quite like a mystery '\n"," 'story.” “Come in, sit down,” he said, leading the way. “You’ll have to '\n"," 'excuse the place. I have to do my own housekeeping, and The Comedian’s '\n"," 'Children 117 I just don’t.” He took a test-tube rack and a cracked bunsen '\n"," 'tube from an easy chair and nodded her into it. He had to make two circuits '\n"," 'of the room before he found somewhere to put them down. “Price of fame,” he '\n"," 'said sardonically, and sat down on a rope-tied stack of papers bearing the '\n"," 'flapping label Proceedings of the Pan-American Microbiological Society. '\n"," '“Where that clown makes a joke of Horowitz, other fashionable people make a '\n"," 'game of Horowitz. A challenge. Track down Horowitz. Well, if they did, '\n"," 'through tapping my phone or following me home, that would satisfy them. Then '\n"," 'I would be another kind of challenge. Bother Horowitz. Break in and stir up '\n"," 'his lab with a stick. You know.” She shuddered. “People are . . . are so . . '\n"," '.” “Don’t say that, whatever it was,” said Horowitz. “We’re living in a '\n"," 'quiet time, Doctor, and we haven’t evolved too far away from our hunting and '\n"," 'tracking appetites. It probably hasn’t occurred to you that your kind of '\n"," 'math and my kind of biology are hunting and tracking too. Cut away our '\n"," 'science bump and we’d probably hunt with the pack too. A big talent is only '\n"," 'a means of hunting alone. A little skill is a means of hunting alone some of '\n"," 'the time.” “But . . . why must they hunt you?” “Why must you hunt gravitic '\n"," 'phenomena?” “To understand it.” “Which means to end it as a mystery. Cut it '\n"," 'down to your size. Conquer it. You happen to be equipped with a rather '\n"," 'rarefied type of reason, so you call your conquest understanding. The next '\n"," 'guy happens to be equipped with fourteen inches of iron pipe and achieves '\n"," 'his conquest with it instead.” “You’re amazing,” she said openly. “You love '\n"," 'your enemies, like—” “Love thine enemies as thyself. Don’t take any piece of '\n"," 'that without taking it all. How much I love people is a function of how much '\n"," 'I love Horowitz, and you haven’t asked me about that. Matter of fact, I '\n"," 'haven’t asked me about that and I don’t intend to. My God it’s good to talk '\n"," 'to somebody again. Do you want a drink?” “No,” she said, “flow much do you '\n"," 'love Heri Gonza?”^ He rose and hit his palm with his fist and sat down '\n"," 'again, all his gentleness folded away and put out of sight. “There’s the '\n"," 'exception. You can understand anything humanity does if you try, but you '\n"," 'can’t understand the inhumanity of a 118 Theodore Sturgeon Heri Gonza. The '\n"," 'difference is that he knows what is evil and what isn’t and doesn’t care. I '\n"," 'don’t mean any numb by-rote moral knowledge learned at the mother’s knee, '\n"," 'the kind that afflicts your pipe-wielder a little between blows and a lot '\n"," 'when he gets his breath afterward. I mean a clear, analytical, '\n"," 'extrapolative, brilliantly intelligent knowledge of each act and each '\n"," 'consequence. Don’t underestimate that devil.” “He . . . seems to ... I mean, '\n"," 'he does love children,” she said fatuously. “Oh, come on now. He doesn’t '\n"," 'spend a dime on his precious Foundation that he wouldn’t have to give to the '\n"," 'government in taxes. Don’t you realize that? He doesn’t do a thing he '\n"," 'doesn’t have to do, and he doesn’t have to love those kids. He’s using those '\n"," 'kids. He’s using the filthiest affliction mankind has known for a long time '\n"," 'just to keep himself front and center.” “But if the Foundation does find a '\n"," 'cure, then he—” “Now you’ve put your finger on the thing that nobody in the '\n"," 'world but me seems to understand—why I won’t work with the Foundation. Two '\n"," 'good reasons. First, I’m ’way ahead of them. I don’t need the Foundation and '\n"," 'all those fancy facilities. I’ve got closer to the nature of iapetitis than '\n"," 'any of ’em. Second, for all my love for and understanding of people, I don’t '\n"," 'want to find out what I’m afraid I would find out if I worked there and if a '\n"," 'cure was found.” v “You mean he’d—he’d withhold it?” “Maybe not permanently. '\n"," 'Maybe he’d sit on it until he’d milked it dry. Years. Some would die by '\n"," 'then. Some are pretty close as it is.” She thought of Billy and bit her '\n"," 'hand. “I didn’t say he would do that,” Horowitz said, more gently. “I said I '\n"," 'don’t want to be in a position to find out. I don’t want to know that any '\n"," 'member of my species could do a thing like that. Now you see why I work by '\n"," 'myself, whatever it costs. If I can cure iapetitis, I’ll say so. I’ll do it, '\n"," 'I’ll prove jt. That’s why I don’t mind his kind of cheap persecution. If I '\n"," 'succeed, all that harassment makes it impossible for him to take credit or '\n"," 'profit inany way.” “Who are you going to cure?” “What?” “He’s got them all. '\n"," 'He’s on trideo right now, a telethon, the biggest show of the last ten '\n"," 'years, hammering at people The Comedian’s Children 119 to send him every '\n"," 'case the instant it’s established.” Her eyes were round. “The logician,” he '\n"," 'whispered, as round-teyed as she. “Oh my God, I never thought of that.” He '\n"," 'took a turn around the room and sat down again. His face was white. “But we '\n"," 'don’t know that. Surely he’d give me a patient. Just one.” “It might cost '\n"," 'you the cure. You’d have to, you’d just have to give it to him, or you’d be '\n"," 'the one withholding it!” “I won’t think about it now,” he said hoarsely, “I '\n"," 'can’t think about it now. I’ll get the cure. That first.” “Maybe my brother '\n"," 'Billy—” “Don’t even think about it!” he cried. “He’s already got it in for '\n"," 'you. Don’t get in his way any more. He won’t let your Billy out of there and '\n"," 'you know it. Try anything and he’ll squash you like a beetle.” “What’s he '\n"," 'got against me?” “You don’t know? You’re a Nobel winner—one of the newsiest '\n"," 'things there is. A girl, and not bad-looking at all. You’re in the public '\n"," 'eye, or you will be by noon tomorrow when the reporters get to you. Do you '\n"," 'think for a minute he’d let you or anybody climb on his publicity? Listen, '\n"," 'iapetitis is his sole property, his monopoly, and he’s not going to share '\n"," 'it. What’d you expect him to do, announce the gift on his lousy telethon?” '\n"," '“I—I c-called him on his telethon.” “You didn’t!” “He pretended the call was '\n"," 'from you. But . . . but at the same time he told me . . . oh yes, he said, '\n"," '‘What you got I don’t want. I’m not up here to do you no good.’ ” Horowitz '\n"," 'spread his hands. “Q.E.D.” “Oh,” she said, “how awful.” At that point '\n"," 'somebody kicked the door open. Horowitz sprang to his feet, livid. A big man '\n"," 'in an open, flapping topcoat shouldered his way in. He had a long horse-face '\n"," 'and a blue jaw. His eyes were extremely sad. He said, “Now just relax. Relax '\n"," 'and you’ll be all right.” His hands, as if they had a will of their own, '\n"," 'busied themselves about pulling off a tight left-hand glove with wires '\n"," 'attached to it and running into his side pocket. “Flannel!” Horowitz barked. '\n"," '“How did you get in?” He 120 Theodore Sturgeon stepped forward, knees '\n"," 'slightly bent, head lowering. “You’ll get out of here or so help me—” “No!” '\n"," 'Iris cried, clutching at Horowitz’s forearm. The big man outreached and '\n"," 'outweighed the biologist, and certainly would fight rougher and dirtier. '\n"," '“Don’t worry, lady,” said the man called Flannel sleepily. He raised a lazy '\n"," 'right hand and made a slight motion with it, and a cone-nosed needier '\n"," 'glittered in his palm. “He’ll be good—won’t you, boy? Or I’ll put you to bed '\n"," 'for two weeks an’ a month over.” He sidled past and, never taking his gaze '\n"," 'from Horowitz for more than a flickering instant, opened the three doors '\n"," 'which led from the laboratory—a bathroom, a bedroom, a storage closet. “Who '\n"," 'is he? You know him?” Iris whispered. “I know him,” growled Horowitz. “He’s '\n"," 'Heri Gonza’s bodyguard.” “Nobody but the two of them,” said Flannel. “Good,” '\n"," 'said a new voice and a second man walked in, throwing off a slouch hat and '\n"," 'opening the twin to the long, loose topcoat Flannel wore. “Hi, chillun,” '\n"," 'said Heri Gonza. There was a long silence, and then Horowitz plumped down on '\n"," 'his pile of Proceedings, put his chin in his hands, and said in profound '\n"," 'disgust, “Ah, for God’s sake.” “Dr. Horowitz,” said Heri Gonza pleasantly, '\n"," 'nodding, and “Dr. Barran.” Iris said, shakily, “I th-thought you were doing '\n"," 'a sh-show.” “Oh, I am, I am. All things are possible if you only know how. '\n"," 'At the moment Chitsie Bombom is doing a monolog, and she’s good for two '\n"," 'encores. After that there’s a solido of me sitting way up on the flats in '\n"," 'the left rear, oh so whimsically announcing the Player’s Pub Players. They '\n"," 'have a long one-acter and a pantomime. I’ve even got a ballet company, in '\n"," 'case this takes that long.” “Phoney to the eyeballs, even when you work,” '\n"," 'said Horowitz. “Quickly and quietly and get the hell out of here, ’scuse me, '\n"," 'Dr. Barran.” “Oh, that’s all right,” she murmured. “Please,” said the '\n"," 'comedian softly, “I didn’t come here to quarrel with you. I want to end all '\n"," 'that. Here and now, and for good.” The Comedian’s Children 121 “We’ve got '\n"," 'something he wants,” said Horowitz in a loud aside to Iris. Heri Gonza '\n"," 'closed his eyes and said, “You’re making this harder than it has to be. What '\n"," 'can I do to make this a peaceful talk?” “For one thing,” said Horowitz, '\n"," '“your simian friend is breathing and it bothers me. Make him stop.” '\n"," '“Flannel,” said Heri Gonza, “get out.” Glowering, the biginan moved to the '\n"," 'door, opened it, and stood on the sill. “All the way,” said the comedian. '\n"," 'Flannel’s broad back was one silent mass of eloquent protest, but he went '\n"," 'out and shut the door. Deftly, with that surprising suddennness of nervous '\n"," 'motion which was his stock in trade, Heri Gonza dropped to one knee to bring '\n"," 'their faces on a level, and captured Iris’s startled hands. “First of all, '\n"," 'Dr. Barran, I came to apologize to you for the way I spoke on the telephone. '\n"," 'I had to do it—there was no alternative, as you’ll soon understand. I tried '\n"," 'to call you back, but you’d already gone.” “You followed me here! Oh, Dr. '\n"," 'Horowitz, I’m sorry!” “I didn’t need to follow you. I’ve had this place '\n"," 'spotted since two days before you moved into it, Horowitz. But I’m sorry I '\n"," 'had to strongarm my way in.” “I yield to curiosity,” said Horowitz. “Why '\n"," 'didn’t my locks alarm when you opened them? I saw Flannel’s palm-print '\n"," 'eliminator, but dammit, they should have alarmed.” “The locks were here when '\n"," 'you rented the place, right? Well, who do you think had them installed? I’ll '\n"," 'show you where the * cutoff switch is before I leave. Anyhow—grant me this '\n"," 'point. Was there any other way I could have gotten in to talk with you?” “I '\n"," 'concede,” said Horowitz sourly. “Now, Dr. Barran. You have my apology, and '\n"," 'you’ll have the explanation to go with it. Believe me, I’m sorry. The other '\n"," 'thing I want to do is to accept, with thanks from the bottom of my heart, '\n"," 'your very kind offer of the prize money. I want it, I need it, and it will '\n"," 'help more than you can possibly realize.” “No,” said Iris flatly. “I’ve '\n"," 'promised it to Dr. Horowitz.” Heri Gonza sighed, got to his feet, and leaned '\n"," 'back against the lab bench. He looked down at them sadly. “Go on,” said '\n"," 'Horowitz. “Tell us how you need money.” 122 Theodore Sturgeon “The only two '\n"," 'things I have never expected from you are ignorance and stupidity,” said '\n"," 'Heri Gonza sharply, “and you’re putting up a fine display of both. Do you '\n"," 'really think, along with all my millions of ardent fans, that when I land a '\n"," 'two-million-dollar contract I somehow put two million dollars in the bank? '\n"," 'Don’t be childish. My operation is literally too big to hide anything in. I '\n"," 'have city, county, state and federal tax vultures picking through my whole '\n"," 'operational framework. I’m a corporation and subject to outside accounting. '\n"," 'I don’t | even have a salary; I draw what I need, and I damn well account '\n"," 'for it, too. Now, if I’m going to finish what I started with the disease, '\n"," 'I’m going to need a lot more money than I can whittle out a chip at a time.” '\n"," 'j “Then take it out of the Foundation money—that’s what I it’s for.” | “I '\n"," 'want to do the one thing I’m not allowed to do with it. Which happens to be '\n"," 'the one thing that’ll break this horrible thing—it has to!” “The only thing '\n"," 'there is like that is a trip to Iapetus.” To this, Heri Gonza said '\n"," 'nothing—absolutely nothing at i all. He simply waited. Iris Barran said, “He '\n"," 'means it. I think he really means it.” “You’re a big wheel,” said Horowitz '\n"," 'at last, “and there are a lot of corners you can cut, but not that one. '\n"," 'There’s one thing the government—all governments and all their armed '\n"," 'forces—will rise up in wrath to prevent, and that’s another landing and '\n"," 'return from any place off earth—especially Iapetus. You’re got close to four '\n"," 'hundred dying kids on your hands right now, and the whole world is scared.” '\n"," '“Set that aside for a moment.” The comedian was earnest, warmvoiced. “Just '\n"," 'suppose it could be done. Horowitz, as I understand it you have everything '\n"," 'you need on the iapetitis virus but one little link. Is that right?” “That’s '\n"," 'right. I can synthesize a surrogate virus from nucleic acids and exactly '\n"," 'duplicate the disease. But it dies out of its own accord. There’s a '\n"," 'difference between my synthetic virus and the natural one, and I don’t know '\n"," 'what it is. Give me ten hours on Iapetus and half a break, and I’ll have the '\n"," 'original virus under an electron mike. Then I can synthesize a duplicate, a '\n"," 'real self-sustaining virus that can cause the disease. Once I have that, the '\n"," 'antigen becomes a factory process, with the techniques we have today. We’ll '\n"," 'The Comedian’s Children 123 have shots for those kids by the barrel lot '\n"," 'inside of a week.” Heri Gonza spread his hands. “There’s the problem, then. '\n"," 'The law won’t allow the flight until we have the cure. We won’t have the '\n"," 'cure unless we make the flight.” Iris said, “A Nobel prize is an awful lot '\n"," 'of money, but it won’t buy the shell of a space ship.” “I’ve got the ship.” '\n"," 'For the first time Horowitz straightened up and spoke with something besides '\n"," 'anger and hopelessness. “What kind of a ship? Where is it?” “A Fafnir. '\n"," 'You’ve seen it, or pictures of it. I use it for globe-trotting mostly, and '\n"," 'VIP sightseeing. It’s a deepspace craft, crew of twelve, and twelve '\n"," 'passenger cabins. But it handles like a dream, and I’ve got the best pilot '\n"," 'in the world. Kearsarge.” “Kearsarge, God yes. But look, what you call '\n"," 'deepspace is Mars and Venus. Not Saturn.” “You don’t know what’s been done '\n"," 'to that ship. She’ll sleep four now. I have a lab and a shop in her, and all '\n"," 'the rest is nothing but power-plant, shielding and fuel. Hell, she’ll make '\n"," 'Pluto!” “You mean you’ve been working on this already?” “Man, I’ve been '\n"," 'chipping away at my resources for a year and a half now. You don’t know what '\n"," 'kind of footsie I’ve been playing with my business managers and the banks '\n"," 'and all. I can’t squeak out another dime without lighting up the whole '\n"," 'project. Dr. Barran, now do you see why I had to treat you like that? You '\n"," 'were the godsend, with your wonderful offer and your vested interest in '\n"," 'Billy. Can you astrogate?” “I—oh dear. I know the principles well enough. '\n"," 'Yes, I could, with a little instruction.” “You’ll get it. Now look, I don’t '\n"," 'want to see that money. You two will go down and inspect the ship tomorrow '\n"," 'morning, and then put in everything you’ll need beyond what’s already there. '\n"," 'You’ve got food, fuel, water and air enough for two trips, let alone one.” '\n"," '“God,” said Horowitz. “I’ll arrange for your astrogation, Dr. Barran. You’ll '\n"," 'have to dream up a story, secret project or long solitary vacation or some '\n"," 'such. Horowitz, you can drop out of sight without trouble.” “Oh, sure, '\n"," 'thanks to you.” 124 Theodore Sturgeon “Dammit, this time you’re welcome,” '\n"," 'said the comedian, and very nearly smiled. “Now, you’ll want one more crew '\n"," 'member: I’ll take care of that before flight time.” “What about the ship? '\n"," 'What will you say?” “Flight test after overhaul. Breakdown in space, repair, '\n"," 'return—some such. Leave that to Kearsarge.” “I freely admit,” said Horowitz, '\n"," '“that I don’t get it. This is one frolic that isn’t coming out of taxes, and '\n"," 'it’s costing you a packet. What’s in it, mountebank?” “You could ask that,” '\n"," 'said the comedian, sadly. “The kids, that’s all.” “You’ll get the credit?” '\n"," '“I won’t, I can’t, I don’t want it. I can’t tie in to this jaunt—it would '\n"," 'ruin me. Off-earth landings, risking the lives of all earth’s kids—you know '\n"," 'how they’d talk. No sir: this is your cooky, Horowitz. You disappear, you '\n"," 'show up one day with the answer. I eat crow like a hell of a good sport. You '\n"," 'get back your directorship if you want it. Happy ending. All the kids get '\n"," 'well.” He jumped into the air and clicked his heels four times on the way '\n"," 'down. “The kids get well,” he breathed with sudden sobriety. Horowitz said '\n"," 'gently, “Heri Gonza, what’s with you and kids?” “I like ’em.” He buttoned '\n"," 'his coat. “Goodnight, Dr. Barran. Please accept my apologies again, and '\n"," 'don’t think too badly of me.” “I don’t,” she said smiling, and gave him her '\n"," 'hand. “But why do you like kids that much?” asked Horowitz. Heri Gonza '\n"," 'shrugged easily and laughed his deadpan laugh. “Never had none,” he '\n"," 'chuckled. He went to the door and stopped facing it, suddenly immobile. His '\n"," 'shoulders trembled. He whirled suddenly, and the famous carven face was wet, '\n"," 'twisted, the mouth tortured and crooked. “Never can,” he whispered, and '\n"," 'literally ran out of the room. «• _________________ Die weeks went by, the '\n"," 'months. Iapetitis cases underwent some strange undulations, and a hope arose '\n"," 'that the off-world virus was losing its strength. Some of the older cases '\n"," 'actually improved, and a blessing that was, J:oo; for although overall '\n"," 'growth was arrested, there was a tendency for the mobile side to grow faster '\n"," 'than the other, and during the improve- The Comedian’s Children 125 ment '\n"," 'phase, the sides seemed to equalize. Then, tragically the improvement would '\n"," 'slow; and stop. Incidence of the disease seemed to be slackening as well. At '\n"," 'the last, there had been only three new cases in a* year, though they caused '\n"," 'a bad flurry, occurring as they did simultaneously in a Belgian village '\n"," 'which had had no hint of the disease before. Heri Gonza still did his weekly '\n"," 'stint (less vacation) and still amazed his gigantic audiences with his '\n"," 'versatility, acting, singing, dancing, clowning. Sometimes he would make '\n"," 'quiet appearances, opening and closing the show and turning it over to a '\n"," 'theater or ballet group. During the Old Timer’s Celebration he learned to '\n"," 'fly a perfect duplicate of a century-old light aircraft with an internal '\n"," 'combustion engine, and daringly took his first solo during the show, with a '\n"," 'trideo camera occupying the instructor’s seat. At other times he might take '\n"," 'up the entire time-segment alone, usually with orchestra and props, '\n"," 'once—possibly his most successful show—dressed in sloppy practice clothes on '\n"," 'a bare stage, without so much as a chair, and with no assistance but lights '\n"," 'and cameras and-an occasional invisible touch from the hypnos and the scent '\n"," 'generators. Single-handedly he was a parade, a primary schoolroom, a zoo in '\n"," 'an earthquake, and an old lady telling three children, ages five, ten, and '\n"," 'fifteen, about sex all at the same time. And in between (and sometimes '\n"," 'during) his shows, he faithfully maintained I. F. He visited his children '\n"," 'regularly, every single one of the more than four hundred. He thrilled with '\n"," 'their improvements, cheered them in their inevitable relapses. The only time '\n"," 'he did not make one of his scheduled shows at all was the time the three '\n"," 'cases appeared in Belgium, and then the slot was filled with news-items '\n"," 'about the terrifying resurgence, and a world tour of I. F. clinics. He was a '\n"," 'great man, a great comic, no question about it, right up to his very last '\n"," 'show. He didn’t know it was his last show, which in its way was a pity, '\n"," 'because with that knowledge he would have been more than good; he’d have '\n"," 'been great. He was that kind of performer. — However, he was good, and was '\n"," 'in and out of a vastly amusing variety show, using his old trick of standing '\n"," 'offstage and singing with perfect mimicry while top vocalists stood 126 '\n"," 'Theodore Sturgeon center stage and mouthed the words. He turned out to be '\n"," 'one of the Japanese girls who built body-pyramids on their bicycles, and, '\n"," 'powered by a spring device under the water, joined «a succession of '\n"," 'porpoises leaping to take fish out of a keeper’s hand. He played, as he '\n"," 'preferred to do, in a large studio without an audience, but playing to the '\n"," 'audience-response sound supplied to him. He made his cues well, filled in '\n"," 'smoothly with ad-libs when a girl singer ran a chorus short on her '\n"," 'arrangement, and did his easy stand-up comedy monolog to close. A pity he '\n"," 'didn’t smile on that show. When the on-the-airs went out and the worklights '\n"," 'came on, he threw a sweatshirt around his shoulder and ambled into the '\n"," 'wings, where, as usual, the network man, Burcke, waited for him. “How’d it '\n"," 'look, Burckee ol’ turkey?” “Like never before,” said Burcke. “Aw, you’re '\n"," 'cute yourself,” said the comedian. “Let’s have a look.” One of his greatest '\n"," 'delights—and one reason for his fantastic polish—was the relaxed run-through '\n"," 'afterward, where he lounged in the projection-room and looked at the show he '\n"," 'had just finished from beginning to end. He and Burcke and a few interested '\n"," 'cast members, backstage people, and privileged strangers got arranged in the '\n"," 'projection room. Beer was passed around and the small-talk used up. As usual '\n"," 'they all deferred to Heri Gonza, and when he waved a negligent hand '\n"," 'everybody shut up and the projectionist threw the switch. ^ Title and '\n"," 'credits with moving cloud-blanket background. Credits fade, camera zooms '\n"," 'towards clouds, which thin to show mountain range. Down through clouds, '\n"," 'hover over huge misty lake. Water begins to heave, to be turbulent, suddenly '\n"," 'shores rush together and water squirts high through the clouds in a thick '\n"," 'column. Empty lake rises up out of clouds, is discovered to be Heri Gonza’s '\n"," 'open mouth. Pull back to show full face. Puzzled expression. Hand up, into '\n"," 'mouth, extracts live goldfish. Gonza: Welcome to the Heri Gonza show, this '\n"," 'week ‘As * you lake it.’ (beat) Which is all you can expect when you open '\n"," 'with a punorama. What ho is (beat) What ho is yonder? A mountain. What ho is '\n"," 'on the mountain? A mountain goat. What ho is the goat mountain? Why, another '\n"," 'moun— Fellers, The Comedian’s Children 127 keep the lens on me, things are '\n"," 'gettin’ a little blue off camera. Now hear ye, Tom, now hear ye Dick, now '\n"," 'hear ye hairy Harry, Heri’s here. Hee hee, ho ho, here comes the show. Soft '\n"," 'focus and go to black. Long beat. Heri took his beer away from his mouth and '\n"," 'glared at the wall. “God’s sake, you send all that black?” “Sure did,” said '\n"," 'Burcke equably. I “Man, you don’t do that for anything but the second '\n"," 'coming. What you think they expect with all that black? It sucks ’em in, but '\n"," 'boy, you got to pay off.” “We paid off,” said Burcke. “Here it comes.” “The '\n"," 'horse act, right?” “Wrong,” said Burcke. Dark stage. Desk, pool of light. '\n"," 'Zoom in, Burcke, jaw clamped. In a face as sincere and interested as that, '\n"," 'the clamped jaw is pretty grim. Burcke: Tonight the Heri Gonza show brings '\n"," 'you a true story. Although the parts are played by professional actors, and '\n"," 'certain scenes are shortened for reasons of time, you may be assured that '\n"," 'these are real events and can be proved in every detail. “What the hell is '\n"," 'this?” roared Heri Gonza. “Did you air this? Is this what went out when I '\n"," 'was knocking myself out with that horse act?” “Sit down,” said Burcke. Heri '\n"," 'Gonza sat down dazedly. Burcke at desk. Lifts book and raps it. Burcke: This '\n"," 'is a ship’s rough log, the log of the Fafnir 203. How it comes to be on this '\n"," 'desk, on your wall, is, I must warn you, a shocking story. The Fafnir is a '\n"," 'twelve-cabin luxury cruiser with a crew of twelve, including stewards and '\n"," 'the galley crew. So was the 203, before it was rebuilt. It was redesigned to '\n"," 'sleep four with no room over, with two cabins rebuilt as a small-materials '\n"," 'shop and a biological laboratory, and all the rest taken up with powerplant, '\n"," 'fuel and stores. The ship’s complement was Dr. Iris Barran, mathematician— '\n"," 'Fade in foredeck of Fafnir, girl standing by computer. / 128 Theodore '\n"," 'Sturgeon Dr. George Rehoboth Horowitz, microbiologist— Bespectacled man '\n"," 'enters, crosses to girl, who smiles.

Widen '\n"," 'lighting to pass cabin bulkhead, discovering large man strapped in '\n"," 'acceleration couch, asleep or unconscious. “I got it,” said Heri Gonza in '\n"," 'the projection room. “A rib. It’s a rib. Pretty good, fellers.” “It isn’t a '\n"," 'rib, Heri Gonza,” said Burcke. “Sit down, now.” “It’s got to be a rib,” said '\n"," 'Heri Gonza in a low voice. “Slip me a beer I should relax and enjoy the '\n"," 'altogether funny joke.” “Here. Now shush.” Burcke: . . . mission totally '\n"," 'contrary to law and regulation. Destination: Iapetus. Purpose: collection*of '\n"," 'the virus, or spores, of the dreaded children’s affliction iapetitis, on the '\n"," 'theory that examination of these in their natural habitat will reveal their '\n"," 'exact internal structure and lead to a cure, or at the very least an '\n"," 'immunization. Shipowner and director of mission: (long beat) Heri Gonza. '\n"," 'Fourteen hours out . . . Fade Burcke and desk and take out. Dolly in to '\n"," 'foredeck. Horowitz crosses to side cabin, looks in on Flannel. Touches '\n"," 'Flannel’s face. Returns to computer and Iris. Horowitz: He’s still out cold. '\n"," 'The tough boy is no spaceman. Iris: I can’t get over his being here at all. '\n"," 'Why ever did Heri want him along? Horowitz: Maybe he’ll tell us. Small '\n"," 'explosion. High whine. Kearsarge: A rock! a rock! Iris: (frightened) What’s '\n"," 'a rock? Kearsarge waddles rapidly to friction hooks on bulkhead, snatches '\n"," 'off helmets, throws two to Horowitz and Iris, sprints with two more into '\n"," 'cabin. Gets one on Flannel’s lolling head, adjusts oxygen valve. Puts on his '\n"," 'own. Returns to assist Iris, then Moskowitz. The Comedian’s Children 129 '\n"," 'Iris: What is it?*. — Kearsarge: Nothing to worry you, lady. Meteorite. Just '\n"," 'a little one. I’ll get it patched. From control console, sudden sharp hiss '\n"," 'and cloud of vapor. ^ Iris: Oh! And what’s that? Kearsarge: Now you got me. '\n"," 'Kearsarge goes to console kneels, peers underneath. Grunts, fumbles. '\n"," 'Horowitz: What is it? Kearsarge: Ain’t regulation, ’sail I know. Horowitz '\n"," 'kneels beside him and peers. Horowitz: What’s this? Kearsarge: Bottom '\n"," 'of.main firing lever. Wire tired to it, pulled that pin when we blasted off. '\n"," 'Horowitz: Started this timing mechanism. . . . What time did it pop? '\n"," 'Kearsarge: Just about 14:30 after blastoff. Horowitz: Think you can get it '\n"," 'off there? I’d like to test for what was in it. Kearsarge gets the device '\n"," 'off, gives it to Horowitz, who takes it into lab. Cut to cabin, closeup of '\n"," 'Flannel’s helmeted face. He opens his eyes, stares blankly. He is very sick, '\n"," 'pale, insane with dormant fear. Suddenly fear no longer dormant. With great '\n"," 'difficulty raises head, raises strapped-down wrist enough to see watch. '\n"," 'Suddenly begins to scream and thrash around. The releases are right by his '\n"," 'hands but he can’t find them. Iris and Kearsarge run in. Kearsarge stops to '\n"," 'take in the situation, then reaches out and pulls releases. Straps fall '\n"," 'away; Flannel, howling, leaps for the door, knocking the midget flat and '\n"," 'slamming Iris up against edge of door. She screams. Kearsarge scrambles to '\n"," 'his feet, takes off after Flannel like a Boston terrier after a bull. '\n"," 'Flannel skids to a stop by the lifeboat blister, starts tugging at it. '\n"," 'Kearsarge: What the hell are you doing? Flannel (blubbering): 14:30 . . . '\n"," '14:30 . . . I gotta get out, gotta get out . . . (screams) Kearsarge: Don’t '\n"," 'pull on that, y’damn fool! That’s not the hatch, it’s the release! We got '\n"," 'spin on for gravity—y’ll pitch the boat a hundred miles off! 130 Theodore '\n"," 'Sturgeon Flannel: Oh, lemme out, it’s too late! Kearsarge punches upwards '\n"," 'with both hands so unexpectedly that Flannels grip is broken and he pitches '\n"," 'over backwards. Kearsarge leaps on him, twists his oxygen valve, and '\n"," 'scuttles back out of the way, staggers over to the boat blister, gets his '\n"," 'hands on the wrong lever again, but his knees buckle. Inside the helmet, his '\n"," 'face is purpling. Horowitz comes running out of the lab. Kearsarge puts out '\n"," 'an arm and holds him back, and together they watch Flannel sag down, fall, '\n"," 'roll, writhe. He puts both hands on helmet, tugs at it weakly. Horowitz: '\n"," 'Don’t for God’s sakes let him take off that helmet! Kearsarge: Don’t worry. '\n"," 'He can’t. * Flannel slumps and lies still. Kearsarge goes to him and opens '\n"," 'valve a little. He beckons Horowitz and together they drag him back to the '\n"," 'cabin and with some difficulty get him on the couch and strapped down. '\n"," 'Horowitz: What happened? I had my hands full of reagents in there. '\n"," 'Kearsarge: Space nutty. They get like that sometimes after blackout. He '\n"," 'wanted out. Tried to take the boat. Horowitz: He say anything? Kearsarge: '\n"," 'Buncha junk. Said, 14:30, 14:30. Said it was too late, had to get out. '\n"," 'Horowitz: That sniwy under the console popped at 14:30. He knew about it. '\n"," 'Kearsarge: Did he now. What was it? Horowitz: Cyanide gas. If we hadn’t been '\n"," 'holed and forced to put the helmets on, we’d’ve had it. Kearsarge: Except '\n"," 'him. He figured to be up an’ around lookin’ at his watch, and when she '\n"," 'popped, he’d be in the boat headed home and we’ keep blasting till the pile '\n"," 'run dry, som’res out t’ords Algol. Horowitz: Can you fix those releases so '\n"," 'he can’t reach them? -y Kearsarge: Oh sure. Fade. Light’s pick up Burcke at '\n"," 'the side. Burcke: (as narrator) They got an explanation out of Flannel, and '\n"," 'it satisfied none of them. He said he knew nothing of any cyanide. He said '\n"," 'that Heri, knowing he was The Comedian’s Children 131 a bad spaceman, had '\n"," 'told him that if it got so bad he couldn’t stand it, he could always come '\n"," 'back in the lifeboat. But if he did that, he’d have to do it before 14:30 '\n"," 'after blastoff or there wouln’t be fuel enough to decelerate, start back, '\n"," 'and maneuver a landing. He insisted that that was all there was to it. He '\n"," 'would not say what he was doing aboard, except to state that Heri Gonza '\n"," 'wanted him to look out for Heri’s interests. No amount of discussion made '\n"," 'anything clearer. Heri certainly could not have wanted the expedition to '\n"," 'fail, nor his ship hurled away from the solar system. They reluctantly '\n"," 'concluded that some enemy of Heri Gonza’s must have sabotaged them—someone '\n"," 'they simply didn’t know. The weeks went by—not easy ones, by any means, in '\n"," 'those quarters, without any event except Iris Barran’s puzzling discovery '\n"," 'that the ship required no astrogator after all: what the veteran Kearsarge '\n"," 'couldn’t handle in his head was easily treated in the computer. Why, then, '\n"," 'had Heri Gonza insisted on her cramming on astrogation? Zoom in to Saturn '\n"," 'until it fills a quadrant. String out the moons. Heri Gonza watched the '\n"," 'bridge sequence, as Saturn swept close and the moons rolled by like broken '\n"," 'beads, and little Iapetus swam close. Iapetus is not a moon like most, round '\n"," 'or oblate, but a rock, a drifting mountain some 500 miles in diameter. And '\n"," 'before them was the solution to the mystery of the changing moonlight. Some '\n"," 'unknown cataclysm has cloven Iapetus, so that it has one sheer face, nearly '\n"," 'four hundred square miles of flat plain (or cliff, depending on how you look '\n"," 'at it) made of pale grey basaltic material. Since Iapetus always maintains '\n"," 'one face to Saturn, it always appears brighter as it rounds the eastern '\n"," 'limb, and dimmer as it goes west, the albedo of the flat/face being much '\n"," 'higher than the craggy ruin of the rest of its surface. “Burckee, Burckee, '\n"," 'Burckee ol’ turkey,” murmured the comedian in accents of wonder, “who the '\n"," 'hell writes your stuff? Who writes your lousy, lousy stuff?” Stdck shot, '\n"," 'Fafnir putting down tail-first on rocky plain, horizon washed out and black '\n"," 'space brought down close. Rocks sharp-cornered, uneroded.

Got that? No further. {Beat) And I can almost tell you '\n"," 'now, we aren’t going to find one blessed thing. No virus, no spore, no '\n"," 'nothing.

Horowitz: What is it? __ Kearsarge: '\n"," 'Scorch. A regular mess of it. Hell, you know what? Swope toppled his ship. I '\n"," 'can see where he came down, where he took off, scraping along to the big '\n"," 'edge there. Flannel: Wonder he didn’t wreck her. Kearsarge: He did. He '\n"," 'couldn’t hurt the hull any in this gravity, but he sure as hell wiped off '\n"," 'his antennae, because there they are: landing, range, transmission—every '\n"," 'one, by God. No wonder he come barrelling in the way he did. You can’t land '\n"," 'a Fafnir on manual, but you can try, and he tried. Poor oP Swopie. Horowitz: '\n"," 'Everybody over there by Kearsarge. Maybe Swope picked up something where he '\n"," 'scraped. Long shot of the four working around long scorch and scrape marks. '\n"," 'Burcke: (off, narrating) They filled their specimen sacks and brought them '\n"," 'aboard, and then for seventy-two hours they went through their dust and '\n"," 'stones with every te§t  Horowitz could devise. ... He had been quite right '\n"," 'in his first guess. The moonlet Iapetus is as devoid of life as the inside '\n"," 'of an autoclave. The Comedian’s Children 133 Cut to foredeck set, but '\n"," 'upended, the controls at highest point, the floor what was the after '\n"," 'bulkhead. Iris moving around with slow shuffle, setting out magnetized '\n"," 'plates on a steel table, each one hitting loudly. In background, Flannel '\n"," 'fusses with small electron mike, watching screen and moving objective '\n"," 'screws. Lifeboat blister open, Kearsarge inside, working. Airlock cycles, '\n"," 'opens, and Horowitz comes in, suited, with sack. He is weary. Iris helps '\n"," 'with helmet. Horowitz: I’ve had it. Let’s get home. We can get just so '\n"," 'duty-bound. Iris: What’s this ‘home’? I don’t remember. Horowitz: You for '\n"," 'home,\"Kearsarge? Kearsarge: Any time you’re through hoein’ this rock. '\n"," 'Horowitz: What are you doing in there? Kearsarge: Just routine. Figured you '\n"," 'might want to buzz around the other side with the boat. Horowitz: Nosir. I '\n"," 'came close enough on foot. I say we’re done here. A man could sit home with '\n"," 'a pencil and paper and figure out the density of subrmicroscopic growth this '\n"," 'place would have to have to bring any back on the hull. We’d be hip deep in '\n"," 'it. The iapetitis virus didn’t come from Iapetus, and that, friends, is for '\n"," 'sure and official. Kearsarge: (off) Oh my holy mother. (He pops out, '\n"," 'putty-colored.) George, get over here. Iris: (curiously) What is it? She '\n"," 'goes over and disappears for a moment inside the boat, with Kearsarge and '\n"," 'Horowitz. Off, she gasps. Then, one by one they climb out and stand looking '\n"," 'at Flannel. Sensing the silence, he looks up and meets their eyes. Flannel: '\n"," 'What I got, blue horns or something? Horowitz: Show him, Kearsarge. '\n"," 'Kearsarge beckons. There is a strange pucker of grim amusement on his craggy '\n"," 'face. Kearsarge: Come look, little feller. Then you can join our club. '\n"," 'Reluctantly, the big man goes over to the blister and follows Kearsarge into '\n"," 'the lifeboat. Dolly after them, swing in to the instrument panel, under it '\n"," 'and look up. Lashed to the projecting lower end of the main thrust control '\n"," 'is a silver can with a small cylinder at the near end. 134 Theodore Sturgeon '\n"," 'Flannel: (pointing stupidly) Is that . . . that the same thing that— '\n"," 'Kearsarge: A little smaller, but then you don’t need as much cyanide for a '\n"," 'boat. Flannel: (angry) Who the hell put it there? You? Kearsarge: Not me, '\n"," 'feller. I just found it. Horowitz: It’s been there all along, Flannel. '\n"," 'Kearsarge is right: you belong to the club too. You sure it was Heri Gonza '\n"," 'told you to take the boat? Flannel: Sure it was. He couldn’t have nothing to '\n"," 'do with this. (Suddenly it hits him) Jesus! I mighta— Horowitz: We’ll have '\n"," 'plenty of time to talk this over. Let’s pack up the testing stuff and haul '\n"," 'out of here. Flannel: (to- no one) Jesus. Heri Gonza lay back in the '\n"," 'projection room and sipped his beer and watched the stock shot of a Fafnir '\n"," 'taking off from a rock plain. “You really get all that glop out of that '\n"," 'book, Burcke m’ boy?” “Every bit of it,” said Burcke, watching the screen. '\n"," '“You know how it is in space, a fellow’s got to do something with his time. '\n"," 'Sometimes he writes, and sometimes it’s fairy tales, and sometimes you can '\n"," 'get a pretty good show out of a fairy tale. But when you do that, you call '\n"," 'it a fairy tale. Follow me?” \\\\ “Yup.” “This was really what went out on the '\n"," 'air tonight?” “Sure is.” Very, very softly, Heri Gonza said, “Poor Burcke. '\n"," 'Poor, poor ol’ Burcke.” Close-up, hands turning pages in rough logbook. Pull '\n"," 'back to show Burcke with book. He looks up, and when he speaks his voice is '\n"," 'solemn. Burcke: Time to think, time to talk it over. Time to put all the '\n"," 'pieces in the same place at the same time, and push them against each other '\n"," 'to see what fits. Fade to black; but it is not black after all; instead, '\n"," 'starry space. Pan across to pick up ship, a silver fish with a scarlet tail. '\n"," 'Zoom in fast, dissolve through hull, discovering foredeck. The four lounge '\n"," 'around, really relaxed, willing to think before The Comedian’s Children 135 '\n"," 'speaking, and to speak carefully. Horowitz and Kearsarge sit at the table '\n"," 'ignoring a chessboard. Iris is stretched on the deck with a rolled-up '\n"," 'specimen sack under her head. Flannel kneels before a spread of Canfield '\n"," 'solitaire. Horowitz is watching him. Horowitz: I like to think about '\n"," 'Flannel. Flannel: Think what? Horowitz: Oh . . . the alternatives. The '\n"," '‘ifs.* What would Flannel do if this had been different, or that. Flannel: '\n"," 'There’s no sense in that kind of thinkin’—if this, if that. This happened, '\n"," 'or that happened, and that’s all there is to it. You got anything special in '\n"," 'mind? Horowitz: I have, as a jpatter of fact. Given that you had a job to '\n"," 'do, namely to cut out and leave us with our cyanide bomb at the start of the '\n"," 'trip— Flannel: (aroused) I tol’ you and tol’ you that wasn’t a job.I didn’t '\n"," 'know about the damn cyanide. Horowitz: Suppose you had known about it. Would '\n"," 'you have come? If you had come, would you have tipped us off about it? And '\n"," 'here’s the question I thought of: if the first bomb had failed—which it '\n"," 'did—and there had^been no second bomb to tell you that you were a member of '\n"," 'the Exit Club, would you have tried to do the job on the way home? Flannel: '\n"," 'I was thinkin’ about it, about what to do. Horowitz: And what did you '\n"," 'decide? Flannel: Nothin’. You found the bomb in the boat so I just stopped '\n"," 'thinkin’. Iris: (suddenly) Why did that really make a difference? Flannel: '\n"," 'All the diff’nce in the world. Heri Gonza tol’ me to get fn the lifeboat '\n"," 'before fourteen an’ a half hours and come back and tell him how things went. '\n"," 'Now if there was just your bomb, could be that Heri Gonza wanted you knocked '\n"," 'off. There was an accident and it din’t knock you off, and here I am working '\n"," 'for him and wonderin’ if I shoon’t take up where the bomb left off. Iris: '\n"," 'Then we found the second bomb, and you changed your mind. Why? Flannel: '\n"," '(exasperated) Whata ya all, simple or somepin? Heri Gonza, he tol’ me to '\n"," 'come back and tell him how it went. If he tells me that an’ then plants a '\n"," 'bomb on me, how could I get back to tell him? A man’s a fool to tell a guy '\n"," 'to do 136 Theodore Sturgeon somethin’ an’ then fix it so he can’t. He’s no '\n"," 'fool, Heri Gonza I mean, an’ you know it. Well then: if he din’t plant my '\n"," 'bomb, he din’t plant your bomb, because anyone can see they was planted by '\n"," 'the same guy. An’ if he din’t plant your bomb, he don’t want you knocked '\n"," 'off, so I stopped thinkin’ about it. Is that simple enough for ya? Iris: I '\n"," 'don’t know that it’s simple, but it sure is beautiful. Horowitz: Well, '\n"," 'one.of us is satisfied of Heri Gonza’s good intentions. Though I still don’t '\n"," 'see what sense it made to go to all the trouble of putting you aboard-just '\n"," 'to have you get off and go back right at the start. Flannel: Me neither. But '\n"," 'do I have to understand everything he tells me to do? I done lots of things '\n"," 'for him I didn’t know what they was about. You too, Kearsarge. Keasarge: '\n"," 'That’s right. I drive this can from here to there, and from there to yonder, '\n"," 'and I don’t notice anything else, but if I notice it I forget it, but if I '\n"," 'don’t forget it I don’t,.talk about it. That’s the way he likes it and we '\n"," 'get along fine. Iris: (forcefully) I think Heri Gonza wanted us all killed. '\n"," 'Horowitz: What’s that—intuition? And . . . shouldn’t that read ‘wants’? '\n"," '/ris: ‘Wants,’ yes. He wants us all killed. No, it’s not in- * tuition. It '\n"," 'formulates. Almost. There’s a piece missing. Flannel: Ah, y’r out of y’r '\n"," 'mind. Kearsarge: Doubled. Horowitz: (good naturedly) Shut up, both of you. '\n"," 'Go on with that, Iris. Maybe by you it formulates, but by me it intuits. Go '\n"," 'on. Iris: Well, let’s use as a working hypothesis that Heri Gonza wants us '\n"," 'dead—us four. He wants more than that: he wants us to disappear from the '\n"," 'cosmos—no bodies, no graves, no nothing. Kearsarge: But why? / Horowitz: '\n"," 'Just you listen. We start with the murders and finish with the why. You’ll '\n"," 'see. Iris: Well then, the ship will do the removal. The cyanide— both '\n"," 'cyanides—do the actual killing, and it hits so fast that the ship keeps '\n"," 'blasting, out and out until the fuel is gone, and forever after that. We '\n"," 'three are on it; Flannel crashes in a small craft and if anybody wonders '\n"," 'about it, they don’t wonder much. Is there any insignia on that boat, by the '\n"," 'wav, Kearsarge? The Comedian’s Children 137 Kearsarge: Always. Iris: Go '\n"," 'look, will you? Thanks. Now, what about the traces we leave behind us? Well, '\n"," 'we tookoff illegally so notified no one and filed no clearances. You, '\n"," 'George, were already in hiding from Heri Gonza’s persecutions; Kearsarge '\n"," 'here is so frequently away on indeterminate trips of varying lengths that he '\n"," 'would soon be forgotten; Flannel here—no offense, Flannel —I don’t think '\n"," 'anyone would notice that you’re gone for good. As for me, Heri Gonza himself '\n"," 'had me plant a story about going off secretly for some solitary research for '\n"," 'a year or so. What’s the matter, Kearsarge? Kearsarge: I wouldn’ta believed '\n"," 'it. No insignia. Filed off and sanded smooth and painted. Numbers off the '\n"," 'thrust block. Trade-name off the dash, even. I ... I wouldn’ta believed it. '\n"," 'Horowitz: Now you’d better listen to the lady. Iris: No insignia. So even '\n"," 'poor Flannel’s little smashup is thoroughly covered. Speaking of Flannel, I '\n"," 'say again that it was stretching credibility to put him aboard that '\n"," 'way—unless you assume that he was put aboard like the rest of us, to be done '\n"," 'away with. I certainly came under false pretenses: Heri Gonza not only told '\n"," 'me he needed an astrogator for the trip, which he didn’t, but had me bone up '\n"," 'on the subject. Now we can take a quick look at motive. George Horowitz here '\n"," 'is the most obvious. He has for a long time been a thorn in the flesh of '\n"," 'that comedian. Not oply has he concluded that Heri Gonza doesn’t really want '\n"," 'to find a cure for iapetitis—he says so very loudly and as often as he can. '\n"," 'In addition, George  is always on the very verge of whipping the disease, '\n"," 'something that frightens Heri Gonza so much that he’s actually hoarding '\n"," 'patients so George can’t get to them. Also, he doesn’t like George. Why kill '\n"," 'Flannel? Is he tired of you, Flannel? Did you boggle something he asked you '\n"," 'to do? Flannel: He don’t have to kill me, Miss Iris. He could fire me any '\n"," 'time. I’d feel real bad, but I wouldn’t bother him none. He knows that. '\n"," 'Iris: Then you must know too much. You must know something about him so '\n"," 'dangerous he won’t feel safe until you’re dead. Flannel: So help me lady, '\n"," 'there ain’t a single thing like that I know about him. Not one. Not that I '\n"," 'know of. 138 Theodore Sturgeon Horowitz: There’s the key, Iris. He doesn’t '\n"," 'know he knows it. Keasarge: Then that’s me too, because if there’s a single '\n"," 'thing I know that he’d have to kill me for then I don’t know what it is. '\n"," 'Iris: You said ‘key.’ Lock and key. A combination of things. Like if you put '\n"," 'what Flannel knows with what Kearsarge knows, they will be dangerous to Heri '\n"," 'Gonza. Flannel and Kearsarge gape at each other blankly and simultaneously '\n"," 'shrug. Horowitz: I can give you one example of a piece of knowledge we all '\n"," 'have that would be dangerous to him. We now know that the disease virus does '\n"," 'not originate on Iapetus. Which means that poor Swope was not responsible '\n"," 'for bringing it to earth, and, further, the conclusion that the little '\n"," 'Tresak girl—the first case—caught it from the wreckage of the space ship, '\n"," 'was unwarranted. Flannel: I brung that picture of that little girl standing '\n"," 'in the wreck, I brung it to Heri Gonza. He liked it. Iris: What made you do '\n"," 'that? Flannel: I done it all the time. He told me to. Horowitz: Bring him '\n"," 'pictures of little girls? Flannel: Girls, boys . . . but pretty ones. I got '\n"," 'to know just the ones he would like. He liked to use ’em on his show. Iris '\n"," 'and Horowitz lock glances for one horrified second, and then pounce all but '\n"," 'bodily on Flannel. Iris: Did you ever show him a picture of any child who '\n"," 'later contracted the disease? Flannel: (startled) Wh ... I dunno. Iris: '\n"," '(shouting) Think! Think! Horowitz: (also shouting) You did! You did! The '\n"," 'Tresak girl—that photograph of her was taken before she had the disease! '\n"," 'Flannel: Well yeah, her. And that little blond one he had on the telethon '\n"," 'that din’t speak no English from Est’onia, but you’re not lettin’ me think. '\n"," 'Flannel: What? Kearsarge: I remember that little blond girl. I flew her from '\n"," 'Esthonia. Iris: Before or after she had the disease? Kearsarge: (shrugging) '\n"," 'The kind of thing I never noticed. She . . . she looked all right to me. '\n"," 'Real pretty little kid. The Comedian’s Children 139 Iris: How long before '\n"," 'the telethon was that? Kearsarge: Week or so. Wait, I can tell you to the '\n"," 'day. (He rises from the chess table and goes to a locker, from which he '\n"," 'brings a notebook. He leafs.) Here it is. Nine days. Iris: (faintly) He '\n"," 'said, on the telethon, three days . . . first symptoms. ^ Horowitz: '\n"," '(excitedly) May I see that? (Takes book, riffles it, throws it on the table, '\n"," 'runs to lab, comes back with cardboard file, fans through it, comes up with '\n"," 'folder.) Iris, take Kearsarge’s book. Right. Now did he fly to Belem on the '\n"," 'ninth of May? Iris: The sixth. Horowitz: Rome, around March twelfth. Iris: '\n"," 'March twelfth, March—here it is. The eleventh. Horowitz: One more. '\n"," 'Indianapolis, middle of June. Iris: Exactly. The fifteenth. What is that you '\n"," 'have there? He throws it down in front of her. Horowitz: Case files. '\n"," 'Arranged chronologically by known or estimated date of first symptom, in an '\n"," 'effort to find some pattern of incidence. No wonder there was never any '\n"," 'pattern. God in Heaven, if he wanted a clinic in Australia, cases would '\n"," 'occur in Australia. Flannel: (bewildered) I don’t know what you all are '\n"," 'talkin’ about. Kearsarge: (grimly) I think I do. Iris: Now do you think '\n"," 'you’re worth murdering—you who can actually place him on the map, at the '\n"," 'time some child was stricken, every single time? Kearsarge: (huskily) I’m '\n"," 'worth murdering. I . . . didn’t know. * Flannel: (poring over the case file) '\n"," 'Here’s that one I seen in Bellefontaine that time, she had on a red dress. '\n"," 'And this little guy here, he got his picture in a magazine I found on the '\n"," 'street in Little Rock and I had to go clear to St. Louis to find him. '\n"," 'Kearsarge hops up on a chair and kicks Flannel in the head. Flannel: '\n"," '(howling) Hooo—wow! What you wanna hafta do that for? Ya little— Horowitz: '\n"," 'Cut it out, you two. Cut it out! That’s better. We don’t have room for that '\n"," 'in here. Leave him alone, Kearsarge. His time will come. Heaven help me, '\n"," 'Iris, it’s been 140 Theodore Sturgeon in front of my nose right from the '\n"," 'start, and I didn’t see it. I even told you once that I was so close because '\n"," 'I could synthesize a virus which would actually cause the disease—but it '\n"," 'wouldn’t maintain it? I had this idee fixe that it was an extra-terrestrial '\n"," 'disease. Why? Because it acted like a synthetic and no natural terran virus '\n"," 'does. Serum from those kids always acted that way—it would cause a form of '\n"," 'iapetitis which would fade out in three months or less. All you have to do '\n"," 'to cure the damn thing is to stop injecting it! Iris: Oh, the man, the '\n"," 'lovely clever man and his family all over the world, the little darlings, '\n"," 'the prettiest ones he could find, whom he never, never failed to visit '\n"," 'regularly . . . (Suddenly, she is crying) I was so s-sorry for him! Remember '\n"," 'the night he . . . tore himself open to tell us he c-couldn’t have k-kids of '\n"," 'his own? Kearsarge: Who you talking about—Heri Gonza? For Pete’s sake, he '\n"," 'got an ex-wife and three kids he pays money to keep ’em in Spain, and '\n"," 'another ex-wife in Paris France with five kids, three his, and that one in '\n"," 'Pittsburgh—man, that comedian’s always in trouble. He hates kids—I mean '\n"," 'really hates ’em. (Iris begins to laugh. Probably hysteria.) Dissolve to '\n"," 'black, then to starry space. To black again, bring up pool of light, resolve '\n"," 'it into: Burcke, sitting at desk. He closes log book. Burcke: This is, I '\n"," 'regret to say, a true story. The Fafnir 203 came in at night six days ago at '\n"," 'a small field some distance from here, and Dr. Horowitz phoned me. After '\n"," 'considerable discussion it was decided to present this unhappy story to you '\n"," 'in the form written up by the four people who actually experienced it. They '\n"," 'are here with me now. And here is a much maligned man, surely one of the '\n"," 'greatest medical researchers alive—Dr. Horowitz. Horowitz: Thank you. First, '\n"," 'I wish to assure everyone within reach of my voice that what has been said '\n"," 'here about iapetitis is true: it is a synthetic disorder which is, by its '\n"," 'very nature, harmless, and which, if contracted, will pass away '\n"," 'spontaneously in from two to twelve weeks. Not a single child has died of '\n"," 'it, and those who have been its victims the longest —some up to two '\n"," 'years—have unquestionably been lavishly The Comedian’s Children 141 treated. '\n"," 'A multiple murder was attempted upon my three companions and myself, of '\n"," 'course, but it was our greatest desire to see to it that that charge is not '\n"," 'pressed. Burcke: I wish to express the most heartfelt apologies from myself '\n"," 'and all my colleagues for whatever measure of distress this network and its '\n"," 'affiliates may have unwittingly brought you, the public. It is as an earnest '\n"," 'of this that we suffer, along with you, through the following film clip, '\n"," 'taken just two days ago in the I. F. clinic in Montreal. What you see in my '\n"," 'hand here is a thin rubber glove, almost invisible on the hand. Fixed to its '\n"," 'fingertips is a microscopic forest of tiny sharp steel points, only a few '\n"," 'thousandths of an inch long. And this metal box, just large enough to fit '\n"," 'unobtrusively in a side pocket, contains a jellied preparation of the '\n"," 'synthetic virus. Fade to: Wild hilarity in a hospital ward. Children in '\n"," 'various stages of iapetitis, laughing hilariously at the capering, growling, '\n"," 'gurgling, belching funny man as he moves from bed to bed, Peep! at you, '\n"," 'peep-peep at you, and one by one ruffling the little heads at the nape, '\n"," 'dipping the fingertips in the side jacket pocket between each bed. Dissolve, '\n"," 'and bring up Burke. Burcke: Good night, ladies, gentlemen, boys and girls . '\n"," '. . I’m sorry. The lights came up in the projection room. There was nobody '\n"," 'there with Heri Gonza but Burcke: all the others had quietly moved and '\n"," 'watched the last few scenes from the doorway, and slipped away. “You did air '\n"," 'jt?” asked the comedian, making absolutely sure. “Yes.” Heri Gonza looked at '\n"," 'him without expression and walked toward the stage door. It opened as he '\n"," 'approached, and four people came in. Flannel, Kearsarge, Horowitz, Iris '\n"," 'Barran. Without a word Flannel stepped up to the comedian and hit him in the '\n"," 'stomach. Heri Gonza sank slowly to the floor, gasping. Horowitz said, “We’ve '\n"," 'spent a lot of time deciding what to do about you, Heri Gonza. Flannel '\n"," 'wanted just one poke at you and wouldn’t settle for anything else. The rest '\n"," 'of THE [WIDGET], THE [WADGET], AND BOFF Part One Throughout the continuum as '\n"," 'we know it (and a good deal more, as we don’t know it) there are cultures '\n"," 'that fly and cultures that swim; there are boron folk and fluorine '\n"," 'fellowships, cupro-coprophages and (roughly speaking) immaterial life-forms '\n"," 'which swim and swirl around each other in space like so many pelagic shards '\n"," 'of metaphysics. And some organize into super-entities like a beehive or a '\n"," 'slime-mold so that they live plurally to become singular, and some have even '\n"," 'more singular ideas of plurality. Now, no matter how an organized culture of '\n"," 'intelligent being is put together or where, regardless of what it’s made of '\n"," 'or how it lives, there is one thing all cultures have in common, and it is '\n"," 'the most obvious of traits. There,are as many names for it as there are '\n"," 'cultures, of course, but in all it works the same way—the same way the inner '\n"," 'ear functions (with its contributory synapses) in a human being when he '\n"," 'steps on Junior’s roller skate. He doesn’t think about how far away the wall '\n"," 'is, some wires or your wife, or in which direction: he grabs, and, more '\n"," 'often than not, he gets— accurately and without analysis. Just so does an '\n"," 'individual reflexively adjust when imbalanced in his socio-cultural matrix: '\n"," 'he experiences the reflex of reflexes, a thing as large as the legendary '\n"," 'view afforded a drowning man of his entire past, in a single illuminated '\n"," 'instant wherein the mind moves, as it were, at right angles to time and '\n"," 'travels high and far for its survey. And this is true of every culture '\n"," 'everywhere, the cosmos over. So obvious and necessary a thing is seldom '\n"," 'examined: 143 144 Theodore Sturgeon but it was once, by a culture which '\n"," 'called this super-reflex “Synapse Beta sub Sixteen.” What came out of the '\n"," 'calculator surprised them. They were, after all, expecting an answer. Human '\n"," 'eyes would never have recognized the device for what it was. Its memory bank '\n"," 'was an atomic cloud, each particle of which was sealed away from the others '\n"," 'by a self-sustaining envelope of force. Subtle differences in nuclei, in '\n"," 'probability shells, and in internal tensions were the coding, and fields of '\n"," 'almost infinite variability were used to call up the particles in the '\n"," 'desired combinations. These were channeled in a way beyond description in '\n"," 'earthly mathematics, detected by a principle as yet unknown to us, and '\n"," 'translated into language (or, more accurately, an analog of what we '\n"," 'understand as language). Since this happened so far away, temporally, '\n"," 'spatially, and culturally, proper nouns are hardly proper; it suffices to '\n"," 'say that it yielded results, in this particular setting, which were '\n"," 'surprising. These were correlated into q report, the gist of which was this: '\n"," 'Prognosis positive, or prognosis negative, depending upon presence or '\n"," 'absence of Synapse Beta Sub Sixteen. The pertinent catalog listed the '\n"," 'synapse in question as “indetectible except by field survey.” Therefore an '\n"," 'expedition was sent. All of which may seem fairly remote until one realizes '\n"," 'that the prognosis was being drawn for that youthful and dangerous aggregate '\n"," 'of bubbling yeasts called “human culture,” and that when the term “prognosis '\n"," 'negative” was used it meant finis, the end, zero, ne plus ultra altogether. '\n"," 'It must be understood that the possessors of the calculator, the personnel '\n"," 'of the expedition to Earth, were not Watchers in the Sky and Arbiters of Our '\n"," 'Fate. Living in our midst, here and now, is a man who occupies himself with '\n"," 'the weight-gain of amebae from their natal instant to the moment thejr '\n"," 'fission. There is a man who, having produced neurosis in cats, turns them '\n"," 'into alcoholics for study. Someone has at long last settled the matter of '\n"," 'the camel’s capacity for, and retention of, water. People like these are '\n"," 'innocent of designs on the destinies of all amebae, cats, camels and '\n"," 'cultures; there are simply certain things they want to know. This is the '\n"," 'case no matter how unusual, elaborate, or ingenious The (Widget), The '\n"," '(Wadget) and Boff 145 their methods might be. So—an expedition came here for '\n"," 'information. EXCERPT FROM FIELD EXPEDITION (NOTE-BOOK) 1. (VOLUME) ONE: '\n"," 'conclusion. ... to restate the obvious, (we) have been on Earth long enough '\n"," 'and more than long enough to have discovered anything and everything (we) '\n"," '(wished) about any (sensible-predictible-readable) culture anywhere. This '\n"," 'one, however, is quite beyond (understanding-accounting-for).

I The town was old enough to '\n"," 'have slums, large enough to have no specific “tracks” with a right and a '\n"," 'wrong side. Its nature was such that a boarding house could, without being '\n"," 'unusual, contain such varied rungs on the social ladder as a young, widowed '\n"," 'night-club hostess and her three-year-old son; a very good vocational '\n"," 'guidance expert; a young law clerk; the librarian from the high school; and '\n"," 'a stage-struck maiden from a very small small town. They said Sam '\n"," 'Bittel-man, who nominally owned and operated the boarding house, could have '\n"," 'been an engineer, and if he had been, a marine architect as well, but '\n"," 'instead he had never risen higher than shop foreman. Whether this '\n"," 'constituted failure or success is speculative; apply to a chief petty '\n"," 'officer of top sergeant who won’t accept a commission, and to the president '\n"," 'of your local bank, andtake your pick of their arguments. It probably never '\n"," 'occurred to Sam to examine the matter. He had other things to amuse him. '\n"," 'Tolerant, curious, intensely alive, old Sam had apparently never retired '\n"," 'from anything but his job at the shipyards back east. He in turn was owned '\n"," 'and operated by his wife, whom everyone called “Bitty” and who possessed the '\n"," 'harshest countenance and the most acid idiom ever found in a charter member '\n"," 'of the Suckers for Sick Kittens and Sob Stories Society. Between thefti they '\n"," 'took care of their roomers in that special way possible only in boarding '\n"," 'houses which feature a big dining table and a place set for everyone. Such '\n"," 'places are less than a family, or more if you value your freedom. They are '\n"," 'more than a hotel, or less if you like formality. To Mary Haunt, who claimed '\n"," 'to be twenty-two and lied, the place was the most forgettable and '\n"," 'soon-to-be-forgotten of stepping stones; to Robin it was home and more; it '\n"," 'was the world and the universe, an environment as ubiquitous, unnoticed, and '\n"," 'unquestioned as the water around a fish; but Robin would, of course, feel '\n"," 'differently later. He was only three. The only other one of the Bittelman’s '\n"," 'boarders who breathed what was uniquely the Bittelman quality as if it were '\n"," 'air was Phil Halvorsen, a thoughtful young man in the 147 The (Widget), The '\n"," '(Wadget) and Boff vocational guidance field, whose mind was on food and '\n"," 'housing only when they annoyed him, and since the Bittel-mans made him quite '\n"," 'comfortable, in effect they were invisible. Reta Schmidt appreciated the '\n"," 'Bittelmans for a number of things, prime among which was the lengths to '\n"," 'which her dollar went with them, for Miss Schmidt’s employers were a Board '\n"," 'of Education. Mr. Anthony O’Banion permitted himself a genuine admiration of '\n"," 'almost nothing in these parts. So it remained for Sue Martin to be the only '\n"," 'one in the place who respected and admired them, right from the start, with '\n"," 'something approaching their due. Sue was Robin’s widowed mother and worked '\n"," 'in a night club as hostess-and sometime entertainer. She had done, in the '\n"," 'past, both better and worse. She still might do better for herself, but only '\n"," 'that which would be worse for Robin. The Bittelmans were her godsend. Robin '\n"," 'adored them, and the only thing they would not do for him was to spoil him. '\n"," 'The Bittelmans were there to give him breakfast in the mornings, to dress '\n"," 'him when he went out to play, to watch over him and keep him amused and '\n"," 'content until Sue rose at 11. The rest of the day was for Sue and Robin '\n"," 'together, right up to his bedtime, when she tucked him in and storied him to '\n"," 'sleep. And when she left for work at 9 p.m., the Bittelmans were there, safe '\n"," 'and certain, ready and willing to cope with anything from a bladder to a '\n"," 'blaze. They were like insurance and fire extinguishers, hardly ever used but '\n"," 'comforting by their presence. So she value them . . . but then, Sue Martin '\n"," 'was different from most people. So was Robin; however, this is a truism when '\n"," 'speaking of three-year-olds. Such was the population of Bittelman’s boarding '\n"," 'house, and if they seem too many and too varied to sort out all at once, '\n"," 'have patience and remember that each of them felt the same way on meeting '\n"," 'all the others. n A pawnshop is a dismal place. A pawnshop in the rain. A '\n"," 'closed pawnshop in the rain, on a Sunday. Philip Halvorsen did not object. '\n"," 'He had a liking for harmony, and the atmosphere suited him well just now, '\n"," 'his thoughts, his feelings. A sunbeam would have been an in- 148 Theqpore '\n"," 'Sturgeon trusion. A flower shop could not have contributed so much. People, '\n"," 'just now, would have been intolerable. He leaned his forehead against the '\n"," 'wet black steel of the burglar-proof gate and idly inventoried the contents '\n"," 'of the window and his thoughts about them. Like the window and its contents, '\n"," 'and the dark recesses inside, his thoughts were miscellaneous, cluttered, '\n"," 'captured in that purgatory of uselessness wherein things are not dead, only '\n"," 'finished with what they have been and uncaring of what will happen to them '\n"," 'and when. His thoughts were binoculars without eyes, cameras without film, '\n"," 'silent guitars and unwound watches. He found himself approving more of the '\n"," 'guitars than the two dirty violins hanging in the window. He almost wondered '\n"," 'why this should be, almost let the question disappear into lethargy, and at '\n"," 'last sighed and ran the matter down because he knew it would bother him '\n"," 'otherwise and he was in no mood to be bothered. He looked at the instruments '\n"," 'lazily, one, the other, analyzing and comparing. They had a great deal in '\n"," 'common, and some significant differences. Having a somewhat sticky mind, to '\n"," 'which windblown oddments of fact had been adhering for nearly 30 years now, '\n"," 'he knew of the trial-and-error evolution of those resonance-chambers and of '\n"," 'the high degree of perfection they had come to. Given that design followed '\n"," 'function in both the violin and the guitar, and aside from any preference in '\n"," 'the sounds they made (actually Hal-vorsen was completely indifferent to '\n"," 'music anyway), then why should he intuitively prefer the guitars he saw over '\n"," 'the violins? Size, proportion, number of strings, design of bridge, frets or '\n"," 'lack of them, finish, peg and tailpiece mechanics— all these had their '\n"," 'differences and all were perfect for the work they did. Suddenly, then, he '\n"," 'saw it, and his mind swiftly thumbed through the mental pictures of all the '\n"," 'violins he had ever seen. They all checked out. One flickering glance at the '\n"," 'guitars in the window settled the matter. All violins have a scroll carved '\n"," 'at the end of the neck— all of them. There is scrollwork on some guitars, '\n"," 'none on others; it’s obviously optional. The back-bending spiral at the end '\n"," 'of a violin’s neck is not optional, but traditional, and it has no function. '\n"," 'Halvorsen nodded slightly and permitted his mind to wander away from the '\n"," 'matter. It wasn’t important—not in itself; only settling it was important. '\n"," 'His 149 * / The (Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff original, intuitive approval '\n"," 'of guitars over violins was not a matter of moment either; his preference '\n"," 'for the functional over the purely traditional was just that—a preference. '\n"," 'None of this required much of Halvorsen’s conscious elfort or attention. The '\n"," 'survey, the sequence, was virtually reflexive, and his thoughts moved as '\n"," 'fish in some deep clear pool might move, hanging and hanging, fanning, then '\n"," 'suddenly darting about with a swirl and a splash, to hang again fanning, '\n"," 'alive and waiting. He stood motionless, the fine rain soaking into the back '\n"," 'of his collar and his eyes unseeking but receptive. Binoculars with '\n"," 'mother-of-pearl; binoculars without. A watch with glass rubies in the face. '\n"," 'Display cards: cheap combs, cheap wallets, cheap pens. An electric steam '\n"," 'iron with a frayed cord. A rack of second-hand clothing. Guns. He felt again '\n"," 'that vague dissatisfaction, set up a certain amount of lethargic resistance '\n"," 'to it, and when it came through anyway he patiently gave it its head. He '\n"," 'looked at the guns. What bothered him about the guns? One had a pearl handle '\n"," 'and rococo etching along the barrel, but that wasn’t it. He glanced down the '\n"," 'row and settled on a .38 automatic, about as functional an artifact as could '\n"," 'be imagined—small, square, here knurled and there polished, with the palm '\n"," 'safety and lock-safety just where they should be. And still he felt that '\n"," 'faint disapproval, that dissatisfaction that spelt criticism. He widened his '\n"," 'scan to all the guns, and felt it just as much. Just as little. It was '\n"," 'categorical then. It had to do with all these guns, or with all guns. He '\n"," 'looked again, and again, and within this scope found no crevice for the '\n"," 'prying of his reason, so he turned the problem on its back and looked again: '\n"," 'what would a gun be like if it satisfied this fastidious intuition of his? '\n"," 'It came in a flash, and he hardly believed it: a flimsy structure of rolled '\n"," 'sheet metal with a simple firing pin on a piece hinged and sprung like the '\n"," 'business part of a rattrap. There was no butt, there were no sights. No '\n"," 'trigger either; just a simple catch and—what was that?—and a piece of '\n"," 'string. He visualized it sitting on a polished surface on a wire stand, its '\n"," 'thin barrel angled upwards about 45°, like a toy cannon. Its caliber was '\n"," 'about .38. The feature which struck him most was the feeling of fragility, '\n"," 'lightness, in the 150 Theodore Sturgeon whole design. Design! What would an '\n"," 'object like that be designed for? He looked again at the pawned guns. Among '\n"," 'the things they had in common was massiveness. Breeches were cast steel, '\n"," 'muzzles thick-walled, probably all rifled; parts were tempered, hardened, '\n"," 'milled, designed and built to contain and direct repeated explosions, '\n"," 'repeated internal assaults by hot hurtling metal. It was as if a little red '\n"," 'signal-light flickered on the concept repeated. Was that it, that all these '\n"," 'guns were designed for repeated use? Was he dissatisfied with that? Why? He '\n"," 'conjured up the image of a single-shot dueling pistol he had once handled: '\n"," 'long-barreled, muzzle-loading, with a powder-pan for priming and a chip of '\n"," 'flint fixed to the hammer. To his surprise he found the little mental red '\n"," 'light still aflicker; this was a design that displeased him too, somewhere '\n"," 'in the area labeled repeated. Even a single-shot pistol was designed to be '\n"," 'used over again; that must be it. Then to him, a gun satisfied its true '\n"," 'function only if it was designed to be used only once. Enough is the '\n"," 'criterion of optimum design, and in this case once was enough. Halvorsen '\n"," 'snorted angrily. He disliked being led by rational means to a patently '\n"," 'irrational conclusion. He cast back over his reasoning, looking for the '\n"," 'particular crossroads where he must have taken a wrong turning. There was '\n"," 'none. At this point his leisurely, almost self-powered curiosity was '\n"," 'replaced by an incandescent ferocity of examination. Logic burned in '\n"," 'Halvorsen as fury did in other men, and he had no tolerance for the '\n"," 'irrational. He attacked it as a personal indignity, and would not let up '\n"," 'until he had wrapped it up, tied it down, in the fabric of his '\n"," 'understanding. He let himself visualize the “gun” of his satisfied '\n"," 'imagination, with its mousetrap firing mechanism, its piece of string, its '\n"," 'almost useless flimsiness, and for a moment pictured police, cattlemen, Army '\n"," 'officers handling such a ridiculous object. But the vision dissolved and he '\n"," 'shook his head; the guns ordinarily used by such people satisfied his sense '\n"," 'of function perfectly. He slipped (hypothetically) into the consciousness of '\n"," 'such a man and regarded his gun—a gun— 151 The (Widget), The (Wadget) and '\n"," 'Boff any gun with satisfaction. No, this seemed a personal matter, unlike '\n"," 'the dissatisfaction everyone should feel (if they cared) about the '\n"," 'extraordinary fact that automobiles are streamlined only where they show, '\n"," 'and are powered by a heat-engine which is inoperable without a cooling '\n"," 'system. What’s so special about my mousetrap gun? he demanded of himself, '\n"," 'and turned his eye inward to look aVit again. There it sat, on a polished '\n"," 'surface—table-top, was it?—with its silly piece of string leading forward '\n"," 'toward him and its muzzle tilted upward, unabashedly showing off its sleazy '\n"," 'construction. Why could be see how thin the metal of that muzzle was? '\n"," 'Because it was aimed right at the bridge of his nose.  Make a statement, '\n"," 'Halvorsen, and test it. Statement: Other guns satisfy other men because they '\n"," 'can be used over and over again. This gun satisfies me because it goes off '\n"," 'once, and once is enough. Test: A dueling pistol goes off only once; yet it '\n"," 'can be reloaded and used again. Why not this? Answer: Because whoever uses a '\n"," 'dueling pistol expects to be able to use it again. Whoever sees it used '\n"," 'expects it will be used again, because the world goes on. After Halvorsen’s '\n"," 'mousetrap gun went off, the world wouldn’t go on. Not for Halvorsen—which of '\n"," 'course is the same thing. “I atn the core and center of the universe” is a '\n"," 'fair statement for anyone. So restate, and conclude: The optimum gun design '\n"," 'is that which, having shot Halvorsen between the eyes, need no longer exist. '\n"," 'Since optimum carried with it the flavor of preferred performance, it is '\n"," 'fair to state that within himself Halvorsen found a preference for being '\n"," 'shot to death. More specifically, for dying. Correction: for being '\n"," 'dead—gladly. Momentarily, Halvorsen felt such pleasure at having solved his '\n"," 'problem that he neglected to look at the solution, and when he did, it '\n"," 'chilled him far more than the fine rain could. Why should he want to be '\n"," 'dead? He glanced at the racked guns in the pawnshop and saw them as if for '\n"," 'the first time, each one very real and genuinely menacing. He shuddered, '\n"," 'clung for a moment to the wet black steel of the gate, then abruptly turned '\n"," 'away. In all his thoughtful—thought-/i//ed—life he had never 152 Theodore '\n"," 'Sturgeon consciously entertained such a concept. Perhaps this was because he '\n"," 'was a receptive person rather than a transmissive one. What he collected he '\n"," 'used on his external world—his job—rather than on himself. He had no need '\n"," 'for the explanations and apologies, the interpretations and '\n"," 'demands-to-be-heard of the outgoing person, so he had no need to indulge in '\n"," 'self-seeking and the complicated semantics of ego-translation. He was rather '\n"," 'a clearing-house for the facts he found, taking knowledge and experience '\n"," 'from here and storing them virtually untouched until they could be applied '\n"," 'there. He walked slowly homeward, in a state that would be numbness except '\n"," 'for the whirling, wondering core which turned and poked and worried at this '\n"," 'revelation. Why should he want to be dead? Philip Halvorsen loved being '\n"," 'alive. Correction: He enjoyed being alive. (Question: Why the correction? '\n"," 'File for later.) He was a vocational guidance worker employed by a national '\n"," 'social service organization. He was paid what he should be according to his '\n"," 'sense of values, and thanks to the Bittel-mans he lived a little better on '\n"," 'it than he might otherwise. He did not work for money, anyway; his work was '\n"," 'a way of thinking, a way of life. He found it intriguing, engrossing, deeply '\n"," 'satisfying. Each applicant was a challenge, each placement a victory over '\n"," 'one or more of the enemies that plague mankind—insecurity, inferiority, '\n"," 'blindness and ignorance. Each time he looked up from his desk and saw a new '\n"," 'applicant entering his cubicle, he experienced a strange silent excitement. '\n"," 'It was a pressure, a power, like flicking on the master switch of a '\n"," 'computing machine; he sat there with all relays open and all circuits blank, '\n"," 'waiting for the answers to those first two questions: “What are you doing '\n"," 'now?” and “What do you want to do?” Just that; it was enough for that '\n"," 'indefinable sense of satisfaction or dissatisfaction to make itself known to '\n"," 'him. And just as he had analyzed its source in the matter of guns, so he '\n"," 'analyzed his clients. That flickering light signaling wrongness, '\n"," 'misapplication, malfunction, misevaluation—all the flaws in design, the '\n"," 'false goals, the frustrations and hurts of those who wonder if they have '\n"," 'chosen the right vocation—that light burned on while he worked on each case, '\n"," 'and would not go out until he found an answer. Once or twice he had wished, '\n"," 'whimsically, that his imagined signal light would illuminate a sign for the '\n"," 'The (Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff 153 client which said Steeplejack and '\n"," 'for that one which-said Frog Farmer, but it refused to be so obliging. It '\n"," 'only told him when he was wrong. Being right involved laborious and '\n"," 'meticulous work, but he did it gladly. And when at last he was satisfied, he '\n"," 'frequently found that his work had just begun: to tell an '\n"," 'eighty-dollar-a-week bank clerk that his proper niche is in freight-handling '\n"," 'with a two-year apprenticeship at 50 is initially a thankless task. But '\n"," 'Halvorsen knew how to be quiet and wait, and had become a past master at the '\n"," 'art of letting a client fight himself, defeat himself, reconstruct himself, '\n"," 'and at last persuade himself that the vocational counsellor was right. And '\n"," 'all of it, Halvorsen liked, from the challenge to the accomplishment. Why, '\n"," 'why should there be a wish in him to haye this cease, to end the world in '\n"," 'which all these intriguing problems existed? And to be glad of its ending? '\n"," 'What would he advise a client, a stranger, if that stranger blurted out such '\n"," 'a desire? ^ Well, he wouldn’t. It would depend. He would simply throw that '\n"," 'in with everything else about the client—age, education, temperament, '\n"," 'marital status, I.Q., and all the rest of it, and let the death-wish throw '\n"," 'its weight along with all the other factors. It would, however, predispose '\n"," 'him to conclude that the man was intolerably misplaced in some area: in a '\n"," 'marriage, a family situation, a social beartrap of some kind ... or his job. '\n"," 'His job. Was he, Halvorsen, judge and arbiter of occupations—was he in the '\n"," 'wrong job? He slouched along in the rain, huddled down into himself to '\n"," 'escape a far more penetrating chill than this drenching mist. So '\n"," 'uncharacteristically wrapped in his inward thought was he that he had taken '\n"," 'three steps on dry pavement before he became aware of it. He stopped and '\n"," 'took his bearings. He stood under the marquee of the smallest and cheapest '\n"," 'of the town’s four theaters. It was closed and dark, this being Sunday in a '\n"," '“blue-law” district, but dead bulbs and locked doors did not modify the '\n"," 'shrillness of its decorations. Over the main entrance were two groups of '\n"," 'huge letters, one for each of the two features on the bill. SIN FOR SALE, '\n"," 'one shrieked, and the other blared back SLAVES OF THE HELLFLOWER. Under '\n"," 'these was a third sign, offering as a special added attraction Love Rites of '\n"," 'a South Sea Eden. From the sidewalk on the far left, up to the marquee, '\n"," 'across 154 Theodore Sturgeon and down the other side was an arch of '\n"," 'cardboard cut-outs of women, wilting and wet, unnaturally proportioned and '\n"," 'inhumanly posed, with scraps of ribbon and drape, locks of hair and induced '\n"," 'shadows performing a sort of indicative concealment on their unbelievable '\n"," 'bodies. Over the, box-office was the stern advice: Adults only!!! and '\n"," 'papering the supporting pillars just inside the mirrored cavern of a lobby '\n"," 'were still photographs of highlights of the pictures: A bare-backed female '\n"," 'with her hands trussed to a high tree-branch, being whipped; a man standing, '\n"," 'gun in hand, over a delectable corpse whose head hung back and down over the '\n"," 'edge of a bed so that her carefully arranged hair swept the floor, and some '\n"," 'flyblown samples of the South Sea Eden with the portraits of its inhabitants '\n"," 'smeared strategically with rubber-stamp ink in angry and careless obedience '\n"," 'to some local by-law. At the best of times this sort of display left Phil '\n"," 'Halvorsen cold. At the worst of times (up to now) he would have felt a mild '\n"," 'disgust leavened by enough amusement at the outhouse crudity of it to make '\n"," 'it supportable—and forgettable. But at the moment things were a Little worse '\n"," 'than the worst had ever been before. It was as if his earlier unpleasant '\n"," 'revelation had in some obscure way softened him up, opened a seam in a '\n"," 'totally unexpected place in his armor. The display smote him like a blast of '\n"," 'heat. He blinked and stepped back a pace, half-raising his hands and '\n"," 'screwing his eyes shut. Behind the lids the picture of his ridiculous '\n"," 'one-shot cannon rose up roaring. He thought he could see a bullet emerging '\n"," 'from its smoking muzzle like the tip of a hot black tongue. He shuddered '\n"," 'away from the millisecond nightmare and opened his eyes, only to get a '\n"," 'second and even more overwhelming reaction from the theater-front. My God, '\n"," 'what’s happening to me? he silently screamed to himself. He pounded his '\n"," 'forehead with his fists twice, then put his head down and ran up the street, '\n"," 'up the hill. His photographic eye had picked up the banner inside the lobby, '\n"," 'and as he ran, part of him coldly read it: SEE (in flaming scarlet) the '\n"," 'big-city orgies. SEE the temptation of a teen-ager. SEE lust run riot. SEE '\n"," 'the uncensored rites of an island cult. The (Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff '\n"," '155 SEE .... SEE .... There was more. As he ran, he moaned. And then he '\n"," 'thought, at the Bittelmans there are people, it is light, it is warm, it is '\n"," 'almost home. He began to run to something instead of away. HI The '\n"," 'Bittelmans’ kitchen was a vague “backstairs” area to O’Banion and a '\n"," 'functional adjunct of the boarding house to Halvorsen; to Miss Schmidt it '\n"," 'was forbidden ground which excited no special interest for that—almost all '\n"," 'the world was forbidden ground to Miss Schmidt. In it Sue Martin was as '\n"," 'content as she was anywhere, and among the torments of Mary Haunt, the '\n"," 'kitchen was a special hell. But in Robin’s world it was central, more so '\n"," 'than the bedroom he shared with his mother, more so than his crib. He ate in '\n"," 'the kitchen, played there when it was raining or especially cold/ When he '\n"," 'went outdoors it was through the kitchen door, and it was a place to come '\n"," 'back to with a bruised knee, with a hollow stomach, with a sudden flood of '\n"," 'loneliness or of a three-year-old’s wild manic passion. It was big and warm '\n"," 'and full of friends. The most resourceful of these friends was, of course, '\n"," 'Bitty, who without ever losing her gruffness knew the right time to apply a '\n"," 'cookie or a story (usually about a little boy with a beautiful mother) or a '\n"," 'swat on the bottom. Sam was a friend, too, mostly as something safe to climb '\n"," 'on. Of late, O’Banion had carved a rather special niche for himself, and '\n"," 'Robin had always liked a limited amount of Miss Schmidt’s self-conscious '\n"," 'passiveness; she was a wonderful listener. He treated Halvorsen with '\n"," 'cheerful respect, and Mary Haunt as if she did not exist. There were other '\n"," 'people, too, every bit as much so as anyone who ate and had a job and '\n"," 'ocupied rooms elsewhere in the house. There was the electric mixer and the '\n"," 'washing machine—in Robin’s economical language “Washeen”—the blendor and the '\n"," 'coffeepot; in short, everything which had a motor in it. (The presence or '\n"," 'absence of motors in percolators is arguable only by those with '\n"," 'preconceptions.) To him they were all alive, responsive and articulate, and '\n"," 'he held converse with them all. He showed them his toys and he told them the '\n"," 'news, he 156 Theodore Sturgeon bade them goodby and good morning, hello, '\n"," 'what’s the matter, and happy birthday. And besides all these people, there '\n"," 'were Boff and Georgie, who, though by no means limited to the kitchen, were '\n"," 'often there. They were not there on that dark Sunday while the sky grieved '\n"," 'and Halvorsen fought his personal devils outdoors. “Mits-ter, Boff an’ '\n"," 'Googie gone for ride,” Robin informed the electric mixer. Its name, '\n"," 'Mits-ter, was identical in his vocabulary with “Mister” and was a clear link '\n"," 'between the machine and the males he heard spoken of, and just another proof '\n"," 'of the living personality he assigned to it. He got a kitchen chair and '\n"," 'carried it effortfully over to the work-table, where he put it down and '\n"," 'climbed on it. He tilted the mixer up and back and turned its '\n"," 'control-cowling, and it began to hum softly. Bitty kept thd beaters in a '\n"," 'high drawer well out of his reach and let him play with the therefore '\n"," 'harmless machine to his heart’s content. “Ats right, Mitster,” he crooned. '\n"," '“Eat your yunch. Hey, Washeen!” he called to the washing-machine, “Mitster’s '\n"," 'eatin’ his yunch all up, I go’ give him a cookie, he’s a good boy.” He '\n"," 'revved the control up and down, the machine whining obediently. He spun the '\n"," 'turntable, turned the motor off, listened to the ballbearings clicking away '\n"," 'in the turntable, stopped it and turned on the motor again. He turned '\n"," 'suddenly at the nudge of some sixth sense and saw O’Banion in the doorway. '\n"," '“Goo’ morning Tonio,” he called, beaming. “Go picnic now?” “Not today, it’s '\n"," 'raining,” said O’Banion. “and it’s ‘good afternoon’ now.” He crossed to the '\n"," 'table. “What you up to, fellow?” “Mitster eatin’ his yunch.” “Your mother '\n"," 'asleep?” “Yis.” O’Banion stood watching the child’s complete preoccupation '\n"," 'with the machine. Little son of a gun, he thought, how did you do it? The '\n"," 'question was all he could express about the strangely rewarding friendship '\n"," 'which flowered between him and Robin. He had never liked (nor, for that '\n"," 'matter, disliked) a child in his life. He had never been exposed to one '\n"," 'before; his only sibling was an older sister and he had never associated '\n"," 'with anyone but contemporaries since he was a child himself. 157 The '\n"," '(Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff Robin had caught him alone one day and had '\n"," 'demanded to know his name. “Tony O’Banion,” he had growled reluctantly. '\n"," '“Tonio?” “Tony O’Banion,” he had corrected distinctly. “Tonio,” Robin had '\n"," 'said positively, and from then on that was inalterably that. And '\n"," 'surprisingly, O’Banion had come to like it. And when, on the outskirts of '\n"," 'town, someone had set up something called a Kiddie Karnival, a sort of '\n"," 'miniature amusement park, and he had been assigned to handle land rentals '\n"," 'there for his firm, he found himself thinking of Robin every time he saw the '\n"," 'place, and of the Karnival every time he saw Robin, until one warm Sunday he '\n"," 'startled himself and everyone else concerned by asking Sue Martin if he '\n"," 'could take the boy there. She had looked at him gravely for a moment and '\n"," 'said, “Why?” “I think he might like it.” “Well, thanks,” she had said '\n"," 'warmly, “I think that’s wonderful.” And so he and Robin had gone. And they’d '\n"," 'gone again, several times, mostly on Sundays when Sue Martin was taking her '\n"," 'one luxurious afternoon nap of the week, but a couple of times during the '\n"," 'week too, when O’Banion had business out there and could conveniently pick '\n"," 'the child up on the way out from the office and drop him again on the way '\n"," 'back. And then, just for a change, a picnic, Robin’s very first, by the bank '\n"," 'of a brook where they had watched jewel-eyed baby frogs and darting minnows '\n"," 'and a terrifying miniature monster that he later identified as a dragonfly '\n"," 'nymph; and Robin had asked so many questions that he had gone to a bookstore '\n"," 'the next day and bought a bird book and a wildflower guide. Occasionally he '\n"," 'asked himself why? What was he getting out of it? and found the answers '\n"," 'either uncomfortable or elusive. Perhaps it was the relaxation: for the '\n"," 'first time he could have communion with another human being without the '\n"," 'cautious and watchful attention he usually paid to “Where did you go to '\n"," 'school?” and “Who are your people?” Perhaps it was the warmth of friendship '\n"," 'radiating from a face so disturbingly like the one which still intruded '\n"," 'itself between his eyes and his work once in a while, and which was so '\n"," 'masked and controlled when he encountered it in the flesh. And there had '\n"," 'been the Sunday when Sue Martin, after having given her permission for one '\n"," 'of these outings, had suddenly said, “I haven’t much to do this afternoon. '\n"," 'Are 158 Theodore Sturgeon these excursions of yours strictly stag?” “Yes,” '\n"," 'he had said immediately, “they are.” He’d told her. But—it didn’t feel like '\n"," 'a victory, and she had not seemed defeated when she shrugged and smiled and '\n"," 'said, “Let me know when you go coeducational.” After that she didn’t put a '\n"," 'stop to the picnics, either, which would have pleased him by permitting him '\n"," 'to resent her. He found himself wishing she would ask again, but he knew she '\n"," 'would not, not ever. And if he should ask her to come, and she should refuse '\n"," '... he could not bear the thought. Sometimes he thought the whole business '\n"," 'of amusing the child was done to impress the mother; he had overheard Mary '\n"," 'Haunt make a remark to Miss Schmidt once that intimated as much, and had '\n"," 'furiously sworn off for all of six hours, which was when Robin asked him '\n"," 'where they would go next. As long as it was simple, a matter between him and '\n"," 'the child, it required no excuses or explanations. As soon as he placed the '\n"," 'matter in any matrix, he became confused and uncertain. He therefore avoided '\n"," 'analyses, and asked himself admiringly and academically, little son of a '\n"," 'gun, how did you do it? while he watched Robin’s animated conversation with '\n"," 'the electric mixer. He rumpled Robin’s hair and went to the stove, where he '\n"," 'picked up the coffeepot and swirled it. It was almost full, and he lit the '\n"," 'gas under it. “Wha’ you do, Tonio? Make coffee?” “Yea bo.” “Okay,” said '\n"," 'Robin, as if granting permission. “Boff doesn’t drink coffee, Tonio,” he '\n"," 'confided. “Oh no.” “He doesn’t, hm?” O’Banion looked around and up. “Is Boff '\n"," 'here?” “No,” said Robin. “He not here.” “Where’d he go? Out with the '\n"," 'Bittlemans?” “Yis.” The coffeepot grumbled and Robin said, “Hello, '\n"," 'Coffeepot.” Halvorsen came in and stood blindly in the doorway. O’Banion '\n"," 'looked up and greeted him, then said under his breath, “My God!” and crossed '\n"," 'the room. “You all right, Halvorsen?” Halvorsen directed blind eyes at the '\n"," 'sound of his voice, and O’Banion could watch seeing enter them slowly, like '\n"," 'the fade-in on a movie screen. “What?” His face was wet with the rain, '\n"," 'fish-belly pale, and he stood slumping like a The (Widget), The (Wadget) and '\n"," 'Boff 159 man with a weight on his back, raising his face to look up rather '\n"," 'than lifting his head. “You’d better sit down,” said O’Banion. He told '\n"," 'himself that this unwonted concern for the tribulations of a fellow-human '\n"," 'was purely a selfish matter of not wanting to shovel the stunned creature up '\n"," 'off the floor. Yet as Halvorsen turned toward the ell with its wooden '\n"," 'chairs, O’Banion caught at the open front of Halvorsen’s coat. “Let me take '\n"," 'this, it’s sopping.” “No,” said Halvorsen. “No.” But he let O’Banion take '\n"," 'the coat; rather, he walked out of it, leaving O’Banion with it foolishly in '\n"," 'his hands. O’Banion cast about him, then hung it up on the broom-hook and '\n"," 'turned again to Halvorsen, who had just fallen heavily back into a chair. '\n"," 'Again Halvorsen went through that slow transition from blindness to sight, '\n"," 'from isolation to awareness. He made some difficult, internal effort and '\n"," 'then said, “Supper ready?” “We roll our own,” said O’Banion. “Bitty and Sam '\n"," 'are taking their once-a-month trip to the fleshpots.” “Fleshpots,” said '\n"," 'Robin, without turning his head. Carefully controlling his face and his '\n"," 'voice, O’Banion continued, “They said to raid the refrigerator, only hands '\n"," 'off the leg o’ lamb, that’s for tomorrow.” Motioning toward Robin with his '\n"," 'head, he added, “He doesn’t miss a trick,” and at last released a broad '\n"," 'grin. Halvorsen said, “I’m not hungry.” “I’ve got some coffee going.” '\n"," '“Good.” O’Banion dropped a round asbestos mat on the table and went for the '\n"," 'coffeepot. On the way back he got a cup and saucer. He put them on the table '\n"," 'and sat down. Sugar was already there; spoons were in a tumbler, handles '\n"," 'down, country-style. He poured and added sugar and stirred. He looked across '\n"," 'at Halvorsen, and saw something on that reserved face that he had read about '\n"," 'but had never seen before; the man’s lips were blue. Only then did it occur '\n"," 'to him to get a cup for Halvorsen. He went for it, and remembered milk, too, '\n"," 'just in case. He brought them back, hesitated, and then poured the second '\n"," 'cup. He put a spoon in the saucer, and with sudden shyness pushed it and the '\n"," 'milk toward the other man. “Hey!” “What?” Halvorsen said in the same dead, '\n"," 'flat tone, and 160 Theodore Sturgeon “Oh. Oh! Thanks, O’Banion, thanks very '\n"," 'I’m sorry.” Suddenly he laughed forcefully and without mirth. He covered his '\n"," 'eyes and said plaintively, “What’s the matter with me?” It was a question '\n"," 'neither could answer, and they sat sipping coffee uncomfortably, a man who '\n"," 'didn’t know how to unburden himself and a man who had never taken up '\n"," 'another’s burden. Into this tableau walked Mary Haunt. She had on a '\n"," 'startling yellow hostess gown and had a magazine tucked under her arm. She '\n"," 'threw one swift gaze around the room and curled her lip. » “Grand Central '\n"," 'Station,” she growled and walked out. O’Banion’s anger came as a great '\n"," 'relief to him at just that moment; he was almost grateful to the girl. “One '\n"," 'of these days someone’s going to grab that kid by the scruff of the neck and '\n"," 'housebreak her,” he snorted. Halvorsen found a voice, too, and probably was '\n"," 'as grateful for the change in focus. “It won’t last,” he said. “What do you '\n"," 'mean?” “I mean she can’t go on that way much longer,” said Halvorsen '\n"," 'thoughtfully. He paused and closed his eyes; O’Banion could see him pulling '\n"," 'himself hand over hand out of his personal swamp, moving to dry ground, high '\n"," 'ground, where he could look with familiarity at a real world again. When he '\n"," 'opened his eyes he gave O’Banion a strange little smile and said, as if in '\n"," 'parenthesis, “Thanks for the coffee, O’Banion,” and went on: “She’s waiting '\n"," 'for the Big Break. She thinks she deserves it and that it will come to her '\n"," 'if she only waits. She really believes that. You’ve heard of high-school '\n"," 'kids who perch on drugstore stools hoping for a movie scout to come along '\n"," 'and discover them. That’s harmless as long as they do it an hour or two a '\n"," 'day. But Mary Haunt does it every minute she’s out of this house. None of us '\n"," 'here could help her, so she treats us the way anyone treats useless things. '\n"," 'But you ought to see her down at the station.” “What station?” “She types '\n"," 'continuities at the radio station,” said Halvorsen. “From what I hear, she’s '\n"," 'not very good, but on the other hand they don’t pay her much money, so '\n"," 'nobody kicks. But to her a radio station is the edge of the world she wants '\n"," 'to crash—it starts there and goes to TV and to the movies. I’ll bet you '\n"," 'anything you like she has a scene all rehearsed in her mind, where a big '\n"," 'producer or director stops here and The (Widget), The (Widget) and Boff 161 '\n"," 'drops in at the radio station to see someone, and bang! our Mary’s a starlet '\n"," 'being groomed for the top.” “She’d better learn some manners,” grumbled '\n"," 'O’Banion. “Oh, she’s got manners when she thinks they’ll do her some good.” '\n"," '“Why doesn’t she use them on you, for example?” “Me?” “Yes. Don’t you get '\n"," 'people better jobs, that sort of thing?” “I see a lot of people, a lot of '\n"," 'different kinds of people,” said Halvorsen, “but they have one thing in '\n"," 'common: they aren’t sure what they want to do, to be.” He pointed his spoon '\n"," 'at the doorway. “She is. She may be wrong, but she’s certain.” “Well, what '\n"," 'about Sue Martin?” said O’Banion. He pursued the subject quickly, almost '\n"," 'thoughtlessly, because of a vague feeling that if he didn’t, Halvorsen would '\n"," 'slip back into that uncomfortable introspective silence. “Surely there’s a '\n"," 'lot about show business Mary Haunt could learn from her.” Halvorsen gave the '\n"," 'nearest thing yet to a grin and reached for the coffeepot. “Mrs. Martin’s a '\n"," 'nightclub entertainer,” he said, “and as far as Mary Haunt’s concerned, '\n"," 'night clubs are slums.” O’Banion blushed violently and cursed himself for '\n"," 'it. “Why that little—no background, no—no—how could she look down on ... I '\n"," 'mean, she’s a little nobody!” Conscious that he was spluttering under the '\n"," 'direct and passionless gaze of Halvorsen’s dark eyes, he reached for the '\n"," 'first thing he could think of that was not an absolute non sequitur: “One '\n"," 'night a couple of months ago Mrs. Martin and I saw her throw a fit of '\n"," 'hysterics over something ... oh, Miss Schmidt had a magazine she wanted . . '\n"," '. anyway, after it was all -over, Mrs. Martin said something about Mary '\n"," 'Haunt that could have been a compliment. I mean, to some people. I can’t '\n"," 'think of Mary Haunt ever doing as much for her.” “What did she say?” “Mrs. '\n"," 'Martin? Oh, she said anybody who gets between Mary Haunt and what she wants '\n"," 'is going to have a Marysized hole through them.” “It wasn’t a compliment,” '\n"," 'said Halvorsen immediately. “Mrs. Martin knows as well as you or I do what’s '\n"," 'between that girl and her Big Break.” 162 Theodore Sturgeon “What is?” * '\n"," '“Mary Haunt.” O’Banion thought about that for a moment and then chuckled. “A '\n"," 'Mary-sized hole wouldn’t leave much.” He looked up. “You’re quite a '\n"," 'psychologist.” “Me?” said Halvorsen in genuine surprise. At that moment '\n"," 'Robin, who had all this while been murmuring confidences to the mixer, '\n"," 'switched off the machine and looked up. “Boff!” he cried joyously. “Hello, '\n"," 'Boff!” He watched something move toward him, turning slightly to follow it '\n"," 'with his eyes until it settled on the spice shelf over his table. “Wash you '\n"," 'doin’, Boff? Come for dinner?!’ Then he laughed, as if he had thought of '\n"," 'something pleasant and very funny. “I thought Boff was out with the '\n"," 'Bittelmans, Robin,” O’Banion called. “No, he hide,” said Robin, and laughed '\n"," 'uproariously. “Boff right here. He come back.” Halvorsen watched this with a '\n"," 'dazed smile. “Who on earth is Boff?” he asked O’Banion. “Imaginary '\n"," 'playmate,” said O’Banion knowledgeably. “I’m used to it now but I don’t mind '\n"," 'telling you it gave me the creeps at first. Lots of kids have them. My '\n"," 'sister did, or so Mother says—Sister doesn’t remember it now. A little girl '\n"," 'called Ginny who used to live in the butler’s pantry. You laugh off this '\n"," '‘Boff’ and the other one—her name’s Googie— until you see Robin holding the '\n"," 'door open to let them in, or refusing to go out to play until they get '\n"," 'downstairs. And he isn’t kidding. That’s a nice little kid most of the time, '\n"," 'Halvorsen, but some things will make him blow up like a little bottle of '\n"," 'nitro, and one of ’em is to deny that Boff and Googie are real. I know. I '\n"," 'tried it once and it took half a day and six rides on a merry-go-round to '\n"," 'calm him down.” He emphasized with a forefinger: “Six rides for Boff and '\n"," 'Googie too.” Halvorsen watched the child: “I’ll be darned.” He shook his '\n"," 'head slightly. “Is that—uh—healthy?” “I bought a book,” said O’Banion, and, '\n"," 'unaccountably, found himself blushing again, “and it says no, long as the '\n"," 'child has good contact with reality, and believe me, he has. They grow out '\n"," 'of it. Nothing to worry about.” Just then Robin cocked his head up to the '\n"," 'spice shelf, as if he had heard a sound. Then he said, “Okay, Boff,” 163 The '\n"," '(Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff climbed down from his chair, carried the '\n"," 'chair across the kitchen to its place against the wall, and said cheerfully, '\n"," '“Tonio, Boff wan see cars. Okay. Shall we?” O’Banion rose, laughing. “My '\n"," 'master’s voice. I got the Popular Electrics special issue on this year’s '\n"," 'automobiles and Boff and Robin can’t get enough of it.” “Oh?” Halvorsen '\n"," 'smiled. “What do they like this year?” “Red ones. Come on, Robin. See you, '\n"," 'Halvorsen.” “See you.” Robin trotted after O’Banion, paused near the door. '\n"," '“Come on, Boff!” He waved violently at Halvorsen. “See you, Have-sum-gum.” '\n"," 'Halvorsen waved back, and they were gone. Halvorsen sat numbly for a while, '\n"," 'his hand still raised. The presence of the other man and the child had been '\n"," 'a diversion from his strange inner explosion and its shock-waves. Now they '\n"," 'were gone, but he would not permit himself to sink into that welter of '\n"," 'approaching bullet, rain-damped torsos, why do I want to be dead? So he hung '\n"," 'motionless for a moment between disturbance and diversion. He thought of '\n"," 'following O’Banion into the parlor. He thought of sinking back into his '\n"," 'panic, facing it, fighting it. But he wasn’t ready to fight, not yet, and he '\n"," 'didn’t want to run . . . and he couldn’t stay like this. It was like not '\n"," 'breathing. Anyone can stop breathing, but not for long. “Mr Halvorsen?” '\n"," 'Soft-footed, soft-voiced, timidly peering about her to be sure she was not '\n"," 'intruding, Miss Schmidt came in. Halvorsen could have hugged her. “Come in, '\n"," 'come in!” he cried warmly. The half-alive smile brightened like fanned '\n"," 'embers at his tone. “Good afternoon, Mr Halvorsen. I was looking, that is, '\n"," 'wondering, you know, if Mr. Bittelman was back yet, and I thought perhaps '\n"," 'that . . .” She wet her lips and apparently thought it was worth another '\n"," 'try. “I wanted to see him about—I mean to say, ask him if he—about '\n"," 'something.” She exhaled, took a breath, and would surely have come out with '\n"," 'more of the same, but Halvorsen broke in. “No, not yet. Sure picked a '\n"," 'miserable day for a joy-ride.” “It doesn’t seem to matter to the Bittelmans. '\n"," 'Every fourth week, like clockwork.” She suddenly uttered a soft little 164 '\n"," 'Theodore Sturgeon bleat of a laugh. “I’m sure I don’t mean clockwork, Mr '\n"," 'Halvorsen, I mean, four weeks.” He laughed politely, for her sake. “I know '\n"," 'what you mean.” He saw her drop her eyes to her kneading hands, divined that '\n"," 'her next movement would be toward the door. He felt he couldn’t bear that, '\n"," 'not just now. “How about— uh—a cup of tea of something. Sandwich. I was just '\n"," 'going to—” He rose. She went pink and smiled again. “Why, I—” There was a '\n"," 'short, sibilant sound in the doorway, a sniff, a small snort of anger. Mary '\n"," 'Haunt stood there glowering Miss Schmidt said, faintly, “No, no thank you, '\n"," 'I’d better, I mean, just go and ... I only wanted to see if Mr Bittelman '\n"," 'was—” She faded out altogether and tiptoed apologetically to the door. Mary '\n"," 'Haunt swung her shoulders but did not move her feet. Miss Schmidt slid out '\n"," 'and escaped past her. Halvorsen found himself standing, half angry, half '\n"," 'foolish. His own last words echoed in his mind: “Sandwich. I was just going '\n"," 'to—” and he let them push him to the other end of the kitchen. He was '\n"," 'furious, but why? Nothing had happened; a lot had happened. He would have '\n"," 'liked to rear back on his hind legs and blast her for persecuting a little '\n"," 'defenseless rabbit like Miss Schmidt; yet what had she actually done? '\n"," 'Couldn’t she say with absolute truth, “Why, I never said a word to her!”? He '\n"," 'felt ineffectual, unmanned; and the picture of the flimsy gun flickered '\n"," 'inside his eyelids and shocked him. He trembled, pulled himself together, '\n"," 'painfully aware of the bright angry eyes watching his back from the doorway. '\n"," 'He fumbled into the breadbox and took out half a loaf of Bitty’s magnificent '\n"," 'home-baked bread. He took down the breadboard and got a knife from the '\n"," 'drawer, and began to saw. Behind him he heard a sharp slap as Mary Haunt '\n"," 'tossed her magazine on the table beside the coffeepot, and then he was '\n"," 'conscious of her at his elbow. If she had said one word, she would have '\n"," 'faced a blaze of anger out of all proportion to anything that had happened. '\n"," 'But she didn’t, and didn’t: she simply stood there and watched him. He '\n"," 'finished cutting the first slice, started on the second. He almost swung to '\n"," 'face her but checked the motion, whereupon the knife bit into the first '\n"," 'joint of his thumb. He closed his eyes, finished cutting the bread, and '\n"," 'turned away to the refrigerator; He opened it and then bent over the '\n"," 'shelves, holding his cut thumb in his other hand. 165 The (Widget), The '\n"," '(Wadget) and Boff “What do you think you’re doing?” asked the girl. “What’s '\n"," 'it look like?” he growled. His cut suddenly began to hurt. “I couldn’t say,” '\n"," 'said Mary Haunt. She stepped to the breadboard, picked up the knife and with '\n"," 'it whisked the bread he had cut into the sink. “Hey!” “You better push that '\n"," 'cut up against the freezer coils for a second,” she said with composure. She '\n"," 'put a hand on the loaf and with one sweep straightened its hacked end. “Sit '\n"," 'down,” she said as he filled his lungs to roar at her. “If there’s anything '\n"," 'I hate it’s to see someone clumsy paddling around in food.” One, two, three, '\n"," 'four even slices fell to the board as she spoke. And again she interrupted '\n"," 'him just as he was forming a wounded-bear bellow, “You want a sandwich or '\n"," 'not? Just sit down over there and stay out from underfoot.” / Slackjawed, he '\n"," 'watched her. Was she doing him a kindness? Mary Haunt doing someone a '\n"," 'kindness? He found himself obeying her, pressing his cut against the freezer '\n"," 'coils. It felt good. He withdrew his hand just as she came toward the '\n"," 'refrigerator, and dodged out of her way. He backed to the table, sat down, '\n"," 'and watched her. She was something to watch. The pale, over-manicured hands '\n"," 'flew. She set out mayonnaise, cream cheese, a platter of cold-cuts, parsley, '\n"," 'radishes. With almost a single motion she put a small frying pan and a '\n"," 'butter-melter on the stove and lit the fire under them. Into the frying pan '\n"," 'went a couple of strips of bacon; into the other, two tablespoons of water '\n"," 'and half the fluid from a jar of capers. She added spices, “by ear”—a shake, '\n"," 'a pinch: poultry seasoning, oregano, garlic salt. The tiny pan began to '\n"," 'hiss, and suddenly the kitchen smelt like the delivery entrance to paradise. '\n"," 'She snatched it off, scraped the contents into a bowl, added cream cheese '\n"," 'and mayonnaise, and thrust it under the electric mixer. She turned the '\n"," 'bacon, shoved two of the bread slices into the toaster, and busied herself '\n"," 'with a paring knife and the radishes. Halvorsen shook his head unbelievingly '\n"," 'and muttered an exclamation. The girl threw him a look of such intense scorn '\n"," 'that he dropped his eyes. He found them resting on her magazine. It was '\n"," 'called Family Day and was a home-making 166 Theodore Sturgeon publication '\n"," 'from a chain supermarket—in no way a movie magazine. Out of the frying pan '\n"," 'came the bacon, crackling. She drained it on a paper towel and crumbled it '\n"," 'into the bowl where the mixer was working. As if some kitchen choreographer '\n"," 'was directing the work, the toast popped up as she reached out her hand for '\n"," 'it. She dropped in the other two slices and went back to her alchemy with '\n"," 'the radishes. In a moment she turned off the mixer and spread the contents '\n"," 'of the bowl on the toast. On this she laid cold-cuts, narrow strips of '\n"," 'various kinds, deftly weaving them so they formed a beautiful basket '\n"," 'pattern. As she finished the first two, the second pair popped out of the '\n"," 'toaster; it was a continuous thing, the way she did all the different things '\n"," 'she did; it was like muisc or a landscape flowing by a train window. She did '\n"," 'something swift with the knife, and set the results out on two plates: '\n"," 'bite-sized sandwiches arranged like a star, and in the center what looked '\n"," 'like a tiny bouquet of rosebuds —the radishes, prepared with curled petals '\n"," 'and nested in a neat bed of parsley, its stems all drawn together by one '\n"," 'clever half-hitch in one of them. The whole amazing performance had taken '\n"," 'perhaps six minutes. “You can make your own coffee,” she snapped. He came '\n"," 'over and picked up one of the plates. “Why, this is—is—well, thanksl” He '\n"," 'looked at her and smiled. “Come on, let’s sit down.” “With you? She stalked '\n"," 'to the table, carrying the other plate, and scooped up the magazine as if it '\n"," 'were a guilty secret. She went to the door. “You can clean up,” she said, '\n"," '“and if you ever tell anyone about this I’ll snatch you bald-headed.” '\n"," 'Staring after her, stunned, he absently picked up one of the sandwiches and '\n"," 'bit into it, and for a moment forgot even his amazement, it was so '\n"," 'delicious. He sat down slowly, and for the first time since he had started '\n"," 'comparing violins with guitars in the pawn-shop, he gave himself up '\n"," 'completely to his senses and forgot his troubles. He ate the sandwiches '\n"," 'slowly and appreciatively and let them own him. excerpt from field '\n"," 'expedition (note-book): So (weary-irritated) (I) can barely (write).

The drapes won’t go across '\n"," 'it and there’s nothing to hang a towel to and the chair-back isn’t high '\n"," 'enough to cover it and—and—oh, dearl” “Oh-h-h.” Struck by something in his '\n"," 'single, slow syllable, she looked sharply at him. There was something—what '\n"," 'was it? like a hum in the room. But it wasn’t a sound. He hadn’t changed . . '\n"," '. and yet there was something in his eyes she had never seen before. She had '\n"," 'never seen it in anyone’s eyes. About Sam Bittelman there had always been a '\n"," 'leisurely strength, and it was there now but easier, stronger, more '\n"," 'comforting than ever. To her, with her multiple indecisions, unsurenesses, '\n"," 'his friendly certitude was more wondrous than a halo might have been. He '\n"," 'said, “Just what bothers you about that window?” Her usual self moved quite '\n"," 'clearly to indicate, indignantly, that part of the window was uncovered and '\n"," 'surely that spoke foritself; yet her usual self was unaccountably silent, '\n"," 'and she gave him his answer: “Somebody might look in!” “You know what’s '\n"," 'outside that window?” “Wh—Oh. Oh, the back of the garage.” “So nobody’s '\n"," 'going to see in. Well now, suppose there was no garage, and you turned out '\n"," 'your lights. Could anybody see in?” “N-no . . .” “But it still bothers you.” '\n"," '“Yes, of course it does.” She looked at the triangle of exposed glass, black '\n"," 'with night outside, and shuddered. He leaned against the doorpost and '\n"," 'scratched his head. “Let me ask you something,” he said, as if her '\n"," 'permission might make a difference. “S’pose we took away the garage, and you '\n"," 'forgot and left your light on, and somebody saw you?” She squeaked. “Really '\n"," 'bothers you, don’t it?” He laughed easily, and instead of infuriating her, '\n"," 'the sound flooded her with comfort. “What exactly is bothersome about that, '\n"," 'aside from the fact that it’s bothersome?” “Why . . .why,” she said '\n"," 'breathlessly, “I know what Yd think of a hussy that would parade around that '\n"," 'way with the lights on and—” “I didn’t say parade. Nor ‘prance,’ either, '\n"," 'which is the other 170 Theodore Sturgeon word people use, I don’t know why. '\n"," 'So what really bothers you is what some peepin’ Tom might think, hm? Now, '\n"," 'Miss Schmidt, is that really anything to worry about? What do you care what '\n"," 'he thinks you are? Don’t you know what you are?” He paused, but she had '\n"," 'nothing to say. “You ever sleep naked?” y She gasped, and, round-eyed, shook '\n"," 'her head. “Why not?” he demanded. “Why I—I—” She had to answer him; she had '\n"," 'to. Fear rose like a thin column of smoke within her, and then a swift '\n"," 'glance at his open, friendly face dispelled it completely. It yvas '\n"," 'extraordinary, uncomfortable, exhilarating, disturbing, exciting all at '\n"," 'once. He compelled her and comforted her at the same time. She found her '\n"," 'voice and answered him. “I just couldn’t sleep . . . like that. Suppose '\n"," 'there was a fire?” “Who said that?” he snapped. “I beg your—” “Who said '\n"," '‘suppose there’s a fire?’ Who told you that?” “Why, I suppose it—yes, it was '\n"," 'my mother.” “Not your idea then. Figured as much. ‘Thou shalt not kill.’ Do '\n"," 'you believe that?” “Of course!” “You do. How old were you when you learned '\n"," 'that?” “I don’t—know. All children—” “Children seven, eight, nine? All '\n"," 'right. How old were you when you were taught not to unpin your diapers? Not '\n"," 'to let anyone see you?” She did not answer but the answer was there. '\n"," '“Wouldn’t you say you’d learned ‘thou shalt not expose thy body’ earlier, '\n"," 'better, more down-deep than ‘thou shalt not kill’?” “I—yes.” “Do you realize '\n"," 'it’s a deeper commandment with you than any of the Ten? And aside from '\n"," 'right-’n-wrong, isn’t it deeper than the deepest, strongest one of all—save '\n"," 'thyself? Can’t you see yourself dying under a bush rather than walk naked '\n"," 'out on the road and flag a car? ‘Suppose there’s a fire?’ Can’t you see '\n"," 'yourself burn to death rather’n jump out a window without your bathrobe?” '\n"," 'She didn’t answer except from her round eyes and her whole heart. 171 The '\n"," '(Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff “Does that make any sense, to believe a '\n"," 'thing like that?” “I don’t know,” she whispered. “I—have to think.” '\n"," 'Surprisingly, he said, “Retroactive.” He pointed to the window. “What can we '\n"," 'do about that?” he asked. Absently she glanced at it. “Never mind it '\n"," 'tonight, Mr Bittelman.” “Sam. Okay. Goodnight, little lady.” She felt '\n"," 'herself, abruptly, tottering on the edge of a bottomless pit. He had walked '\n"," 'in here and disoriented her, ripped into shreds a whole idea-matrix which '\n"," 'had rested undisturbed in the foundations of her thinking, like a '\n"," 'cornerstone. Just at this startled second she had not made the admission, '\n"," 'but she would have to admit to herself soon that she must think '\n"," '“retroactive,” as he had put it, and that when she did she would find that '\n"," 'the clothes convention was not the only one she would have to reappraise. '\n"," 'The inescapable, horizonless, unfamiliar task loomed over her like a black '\n"," 'cloud—her only comfort, her only handhold was Sam Bittelman, and he was '\n"," 'leaving. “No!” she cried. “No! No! No!” He turned back, smiling, and that '\n"," 'magic happened again, his sureness and ease. She stood gasping as if she had '\n"," 'run up a hill. “It’s all right, little lady.” “Why did you tell me all this? '\n"," 'Why?” she asked pathetically. “You know something? I didn’t tell you a '\n"," 'thing,” he said gently. “I just asked questions. They were all questions you '\n"," 'could’ve asked yourself. And what’s got you scared is answers —answers that '\n"," 'came from here—” He put a gentle knuckle against her damp forehead. “■—and '\n"," 'not from me. You’ve lived with it all quite a while; you got nothing to fear '\n"," 'from it now.” And before she could answer he had waved one capable hand, '\n"," 'winked, and was gone. For a long time she stood there, trembling and afraid '\n"," 'to think. At last she let her open eyes see again, and although they saw '\n"," 'nothing but the open door, it was as if some of Sam’s comfort slipped in '\n"," 'with vision. She turned around, and around again, taking in the whole room '\n"," 'and reaping comfort and more comfort from the walls, as if Sam had hung it '\n"," 'for her to gather like ripe berries. She put it all in the new empty place '\n"," 'within her, not to fill, but at least to be there and to live with until she '\n"," 'could get more. Suddenly her gaze 172 Theodore Sturgeon met the silly little '\n"," 'wastebasket sitting against the door, holding it open, and to her utter '\n"," 'astonishment she laughed at it She picked it up, shook her head at it as if '\n"," 'it had been a ridiculous puppy which had been eating her talcum powder; she '\n"," 'even spanked it lightly, once, and j>ut it down, and closed the door. She '\n"," 'got into bed and put out the light without even looking at the window. v '\n"," '“Aw, you shouldn’t!” cried Bitty with a joyous sort of chagrin as she pushed '\n"," 'open Sue Martin’s door. “Here I’ve got all your fresh linen and youwe went '\n"," 'and made the bed!” Sue Martin, sleep-tousled and lovely in a dark negligee, '\n"," 'rose from the writing desk. “I’m sorry, Bitty. I forgot it was Thursday.” '\n"," '“Well Thursday it is,” the older woman scolded, and now I’ll have to do it '\n"," 'up all over again. Young lady, I’ve told and told you I’ll take care of the '\n"," 'room.” “You have plenty to do,” Sue smiled. “Here, I’ll help. What’s Robin '\n"," 'up to?” Together they took down the spread, the light blanket, then the '\n"," 'sheets from the big double bed. “Kidnaped by that young idiot O’Banion '\n"," 'again. He’s driving out to the new project over Huttonville way and thought '\n"," 'Robin might want to see the bulldozers.” “Robin loves bulldozers. He’s not '\n"," 'an idiot.” “He’s an idiot,” said Bitty gruffly, apparently needing no '\n"," 'translation of the two parts of Sue’s statement. “Time this was turned, '\n"," 'since we’re both here,” she said, swatting the mattress. “All right.” Sue '\n"," 'Martin loosely folded the spread and blanket and carried them to the chest. '\n"," '“Robin just loves him.” “So do you.” Sue’s eyes widened. She shot a look at '\n"," 'the other woman, but Bitty’s back was turned as she bent over the bed. When '\n"," 'she spoke, her voice was perfectly controlled. “Yes, for some time.” She '\n"," 'went to stand beside Bitty and they laid hold of the mattress straps. '\n"," '“Ready?” Together they heaved and the mattress rose up, teetered for a '\n"," 'moment on edge, and fell back the other way. They pulled it straight. “Well, '\n"," 'what are you doing about it?” Bitty demanded. 173 The (Widget), The (Wadget) '\n"," 'and Boff Sue found her eyes captured by Bitty’s for a strange moment. She '\n"," 'saw herself, in a flash of analog, walking purposefully away, from some '\n"," 'tired, dark place toward something she wanted; and as she walked there '\n"," 'appeared ramming softly behind her, around her, something like a moving '\n"," 'wall. She had a deep certainty that she could not stop nor turn aside; but '\n"," 'that as long as she kept moving at the same speed, in the same direction, '\n"," 'the moving wall could not affect her. She —and it—were moving toward what '\n"," 'she wanted, just as fast as she cared to go. While this was the case, she '\n"," 'was not being restrained or compelled, helped nor hindered. So she would not '\n"," 'fear this thing, fight it or even question it. It could not possibly change '\n"," 'anything. In effect, irresistible as it might be, it need not and therefore '\n"," 'did not exist for her. Here and now, some inexplicable something had '\n"," 'happened to make it impossible not to answer Bitty’s questions—and this '\n"," 'compulsion was of no moment at all for her as long as Bitty asked questions '\n"," 'she wanted to answer. “What are you doing about it?” was such a question. '\n"," '“Everything I should do,” said Sue Martin. “Nothing at all.” Bitty grunted '\n"," 'noncommittally. She took a folded sheet from the top of the highboy and '\n"," 'shook it out across the bed. Sue Martin went round to the other side and '\n"," 'caught it. She said, “He has to know why, that’s all, and he can’t do '\n"," 'anything or say anything until he does know.” “Why what?” Bitty asked '\n"," 'bluntly. “Why he loves me.” “Oh—you know that, do you?” This was one '\n"," 'question, compulsion or no, that Sue Martin did not bother to answer. It was '\n"," 'on the order of “Is this really a bed?” or “Is it Thursday?” So Bitty asked '\n"," 'another: “And you’re just waiting, like a little edelweiss on an Alp, for '\n"," 'him to climb the mountain and pick you?” “Waiting?” Sue repeated, puzzled. '\n"," '“You’re not doing anything about it, are you?” “I’m being myself,” said Sue '\n"," 'Martin. “I’m living my life. What I have to give him—anyone who’s right for '\n"," 'me—is all I am, all I do for the rest of my life. As long as he wants '\n"," 'something more, or something different, nothing can happen.” She closed her '\n"," 'eyes for a moment. “No, I’m not waiting, exactly. Put it this way: I know '\n"," 'how to be content with what 174 Theodore Sturgeon I am and what I’m doing. '\n"," 'Either Tony will knock down that barrier he’s built, or he won’t. Either way '\n"," 'I know what’s going to happen, and it’s good.” “That wall—why don’t you take '\n"," 'a pickax and beat it down?” She flashed the older woman a smile. “He’d '\n"," 'defend it. Men get very fond of the things they defend, especially when they '\n"," 'find themselves defending something stupid.” Bitty shook out the second '\n"," 'sheet. “And don’t you have any of his kind *of trouble—wondering why you '\n"," 'love him?” Sue Martin laughed. “Wouldn’t we live in a funny world if we had '\n"," 'to understand everything that was real, or it wouldn’t exist? It’s always '\n"," 'good to know why. It isn’t always necessary. Tony’ll find that out one day.” '\n"," 'She sobered. “Or he won’t Hand me a pillowslip.”  They finished their task '\n"," 'in silence. Bitty bundled up the old linen and trudged out. Sue Martin stood '\n"," 'looking after her. “I hope she wasn’t disappointed,” she murmured, and, “I '\n"," 'don’t think so . . . and what did I mean by that?” VI One morning Mary Haunt '\n"," 'opened her eyes and refused to believe them. For a moment she lay still '\n"," 'looking at the window numbly; there was something wrong with it, and a wrong '\n"," 'feeling about the whole room. Then she identified it: there was sunlight '\n"," 'streaming in and down through the Venetian blind where no sunlight should be '\n"," 'at her rising time. She snatched her watch off the night table and squinted '\n"," 'at it, and moaned. She reared up in bed and peered at the alarm clock, then '\n"," 'turned and punched furiously at the pillow. She bounded out of bed, '\n"," 'struggled into her yellow robe, and flew out of the room with her bare feet '\n"," 'slapping angrily down the long corridor. Sam Bittelman was sitting at the '\n"," 'kitchen table peering at the morning paper over the tops of his black-rimmed '\n"," 'reading-glasses. Bitty was at the sink. “What’m I, the forgotten man or '\n"," 'something?” Mary Haunt demanded harshly. Sam put down his paper and only '\n"," 'then began to remove his gaze from it. “M-m-m? Oh, good morning, gal.” Bitty '\n"," 'went on with her business. “Good nothing! Don’t you know what time it is?” '\n"," '“Sure do.” The (Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff 175 “What’s the big fat idea '\n"," 'leaving me to sleep like this? You know I got to get to work in the '\n"," 'morning.” “Who called you four times?” said Bitty without turning around or '\n"," 'raising her voice. “Who went in and shook you, and got told get out of my '\n"," 'room for it?” Mary Haunt poised between pace and pace, between syllables. '\n"," 'Now that Bitty mentioned it, she did half-remember a vague hammering '\n"," 'somewhere, a hand on her shoulder . . . but that was a dream, or the middle '\n"," 'of the night or—or had she really chased the old lady out? “Arrgh,” she '\n"," 'growled disgustedly. She stamped out into the foyer and snatched up the '\n"," 'phone. She dialed. “Get me Muller,” she snapped at the voice that answered. '\n"," '“Muller,” said the phone. “Mary Haunt here. I’m sick today. I’m not coming '\n"," 'in.” “So with this phone call,” said the telephone, “I’ll notice.” “Why you '\n"," 'lousy Heine, without me you couldn’t run a yo-yo, let alone a radio '\n"," 'station!” she shouted, but she had hung up before she started to shout. She '\n"," 'padded back into the kitchen and sat down at the table. “Got coffee?” Bitty, '\n"," 'still with her back turned, nodded in the appropriate direction and said, '\n"," '“On the stove,” but Sam folded his paper and got up. He went to the stove, '\n"," 'touched the pot briefly with the back of his hand, picking up a cup and '\n"," 'saucer on the way. “You’ll want milk.” “You know better than that,” she '\n"," 'said, arching her lean body. While she poured herself a cup, Sam sat down at '\n"," 'the other end of the table. He leaned his weight on his elbows, his forearms '\n"," 'and worn hands flat on the table. Something like the almost-silent whisper '\n"," 'from a high-speed fan made her look up. “What are you looking at?” He didn’t '\n"," 'answer her question. “Why do you claim to bej twenty-two?” he asked instead, '\n"," 'and quick as the rebound of billiard ball from cue ball, propelled by '\n"," 'hostility, inclusive as buckshot, her reply jetted up: “What’s it to you?\" '\n"," 'But it never reached her lips; instead she said “I have to,” and then sat '\n"," 'there astounded. Once she had worn out a favored phonograph record, knew '\n"," 'every note, every beat of it, and she had replaced it; and for once the '\n"," 'record company had made a mistake and the record was not what the label said '\n"," 'it was. The first half-second of that new record was like this, a mo- 176 '\n"," 'Theodore Sturgeon ment of expectation and stunned disbelief. This was even '\n"," 'more immediate and personal, however; it was like mounting ten steps in the '\n"," 'dark and finding, shockingly, that there were only nine in the flight. From '\n"," 'this moment until she left the kitchen, she was internally numb and '\n"," 'frightened, yet fascinated, as her mind formed one set of words and others '\n"," 'came out. “You have to,” asked Sam mildly, “the way you have to be in the '\n"," 'movies? You just have to?” The snarl, have I kept it a secret? came out, '\n"," '“It’s what I want.” “Is it?” There didn’t seem to be any answer to that, on '\n"," 'any level. She waited, tense. “What you’re doing—the job at the radio '\n"," 'station—living here in this town instead of someplace else—all of it; is '\n"," 'what you’re doing the best way to get what you want?” Why else would 1 put '\n"," 'up with it all—the town, the people —you? But she said, “I think so.” Then '\n"," 'she said, “I’ve thought so.” “Why don’t you talk to young Halvorsen? He '\n"," 'might be able to find something you’d do even better’n going to Hollywood.” '\n"," '“I don’t want to find anything better!” This time there was no confusion. '\n"," 'From the other end of the room, Bitty asked, “Were you always so all-fired '\n"," 'pretty, Mary Haunt? Even when you were a little girl?” “Everyone always said '\n"," 'so.” “Ever wish you weren’t?” Are you out of your mind? “I . . . don’t think '\n"," 'so,” she whispered. Gently, Sam asked her, “Did they throw you out, gal? '\n"," 'Make you leave home?” Defiantly, defensively, They treated me like a little '\n"," 'princess at home, like a piece of fine glassware. They carried my books and '\n"," 'felt good all day if I smiled. They did what 1 wanted,, what they thought I '\n"," 'wanted, at home or in town. They acted as if 1 was too good to walk that '\n"," 'ground, breathe that air, they jumped at the chance to take advantage of '\n"," 'being at the same place at the same time; they did everything for me they '\n"," 'could think of doing, as if they had to hurry or Td be gone. 177 The '\n"," '(Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff Throw me out? Why, you old fool! “I left '\n"," 'home my own self,” she said. “Because I had to, like—” But here words failed '\n"," 'her, and she determined not to cry, and she determined not to cry, and she '\n"," 'cried. “Better drink your coffee.” She did, and then she wanted something to '\n"," 'eat with it, but couldn’t bear to sit with these people any longer. She '\n"," 'sniffed angrily. “I don’t know what’s the matter with me,” she said. “I '\n"," 'never overslept before.” “Long as you know what you want,” said Sam, and '\n"," 'whether that was the stupid, non-sequitur remark of a doddering dotard, or '\n"," 'something quite different, she did not know. “Well,” she said, rising '\n"," 'abruptly; and then felt foolish because there was nothing else to say. She '\n"," 'escaped back to her room and to bed, and huddled there most of the day dully '\n"," 'regarding the two coddled ends of her life, pampering in the past and '\n"," 'pampering in the future, while trying to ignore today with its empty stomach '\n"," 'and its buzzing head. VII During Prohibition it had been a restaurant, in '\n"," 'that category which is better than just “nice” but not as good as '\n"," '“exclusive”; the town was too small then to have anything exclusive. Now it '\n"," 'was a bar as well, and although there was imitation Carrara on some walls, '\n"," 'and a good deal of cove-lighting, the balcony had never been altered and '\n"," 'still boasted the turned-spoke railing all the way around, looking like a '\n"," 'picket fence that had gone to heaven. There was a little service bar up '\n"," 'there, and a man could stay all evening watching what went on down below '\n"," 'without being seen. This was what Tony O’Banion was doing, and he was doing '\n"," 'it because he had felt like a drink and had never been to the club before, '\n"," 'and he wanted to see what kind of place it was and what Sue Martin did '\n"," 'there; and every one of these reasons were superficial—if he preceded them '\n"," 'with “why,” he felt lost. Within him were the things he believed, about the '\n"," 'right sort of people, about background, breeding and blood. Around him was '\n"," 'this place, as real as the things he believed in. Why he was here, why he '\n"," 'wanted a drink just now, why he wanted to see the place and what happened in '\n"," 'it—this was a bridge between one reality and the other, and a misty, '\n"," 'maddening, nebulous 178 Theodore Sturgeon bridge it was. He drank, and '\n"," 'waited to see her emerge from the small door by the bandstand, and when she '\n"," 'did he watched her move to the piano and help the pianist, a disheveled '\n"," 'young man, stack and restack and shuffle his music, and he drank. He drank, '\n"," 'and watched her go to the cashier and spend a time over a ledger and a pile '\n"," 'of checks. She disappeared through the swinging doors into the kitchen, and '\n"," 'he drank; he drank and she came out talking to a glossy man in a tuxedo, and '\n"," 'he winced when they laughed. At length the lights dimmed and the glossy man '\n"," 'introduced her and she sang in a full, pleasant voice something about a boy '\n"," 'next door, and someone else played an accordion which was the barest shade '\n"," 'out-of tune with the piano. Then the piano had a solo, and the man sang the '\n"," 'last chorus, after which the lights came up again and he asked the folks to '\n"," 'stick around for the main show at ten sharp. Then the accordion and the '\n"," 'piano began to make dance music. It was all unremarkable, and Tony didn’t '\n"," 'know why he stayed. He stayed, though: “Waiter! Do it again.” , “Do it '\n"," 'twice.” Tony spun around. “Time someone else bought, hm?” said Sam '\n"," 'Bittelman. He sat down. “Sam! Well, sit down. Oh, you are.” Tony laughed '\n"," 'embar-rassedly. His tongue was thick and he was immeasurably glad to see the '\n"," 'old man. He was going to wonder why until he remembered that he’d sworn off '\n"," 'wondering why just now. He was going to ask what Sam was doing there and '\n"," 'then decided Sam would only ask him the same, and it was a question he '\n"," 'didn’t want to fool with just now. Yes he did. “I’m down here slumming in '\n"," 'the fleshpots and watching the lower orders cavorting and carousing,” he '\n"," 'blurted, making an immense effort to be funny. He wasn’t funny. He sounded '\n"," 'like a little snob, and a tight little snob at that. Sam regarded him '\n"," 'gravely, not disapproving, not approving. “Sue Martin know you’re here?” '\n"," '“No.” “Good.” The waiter came just in time; Sam’s single syllable had given '\n"," 'him a hard hurt; but for all the pain, it was an impersonal thing, like '\n"," 'getting hit by a golfer on his backswing. When the waiter had gone Sam asked '\n"," 'quietly, “Why don’t you marry the girl?” 179 The (Widget), The (Wadget) and '\n"," 'Boff “What’re ya—kidding?” Sam shook his head. O’Banion looked into his eyes '\n"," 'and away, then down at Sue Martin where she leaned against the piano, '\n"," 'leafing through some music. “Why dont you marry the girl? “You mean if she’d '\n"," 'have me?” It was not the way he felt, but it was something to say. He '\n"," 'glanced at Sam’s face, which was still waiting for a real answer. All right '\n"," 'then. “It wouldn’t be right.” “ ‘Right’?” Sam repeated. O’Banion nipped his '\n"," 'thick tongue in the hope it might wake his brains up. The rightness of it . '\n"," '. . vividly he recalled his Mother’s words on the subject: “Aside from the '\n"," 'amount of trouble you’ll save yourself, Anthony, you must remember that it’s '\n"," 'not only your right, it’s your duty not to marry beneath your class. Fine '\n"," 'hounds, fine horses, fine humans, my dear; it’s breeding that matters.” That '\n"," 'was all very well, but how to say it to this kind old man, himself obviously '\n"," 'a manual worker all his life? O’Banion was not a cruel man, and he was well '\n"," 'aware that coarse origins did not always mean dull sensibilities. Actually, '\n"," 'some of these people were very sensitive. So he made a genuinely noble try '\n"," 'at simultaneous truth and kindness: “I’ve always felt it’s wiser to form '\n"," 'relationships like that with—uh—people of one’s own kind.” “You mean, people '\n"," 'with as much money as you got?” “No!” O’Banion was genuinely shocked. '\n"," '“That’s no longer a standard to go by, and it probably never was, not by '\n"," 'itself.” He laughed ruefully and added. “Besides, there hasn’t been any '\n"," 'money in my family since I can remember. Not since 1929.” “Then what’s your '\n"," 'kind of people?” How? How? “It’s . I. . a way of life,” he said at length. '\n"," 'That pleased him. “A way of life,” he repeated, and took a drink. He hoped '\n"," 'Sam wouldn’t pursue the subject any further. Why examine something when '\n"," 'you’re content with it the way it is? “Why are you here anyway, boy?” Sam '\n"," 'asked. “I mean, in this town instead of in the city, or New York or some '\n"," 'place?” “I’m good for a junior partnership in another year or so. Then I can '\n"," 'transfer as a junior partner to a big firm. If I’d gone straight to the city '\n"," 'it would take me twice as long to get up there.” Sam nodded. “Pretty cute. '\n"," 'Why the law? I always figured 180 Theodore Sturgeon lawyer’s work was pretty '\n"," 'tough and pretty dusty for a young man.” His Mother had said, “Of course the '\n"," 'law field’s being invaded by all sorts of riffraff now—but what isn’t? '\n"," 'However, it’s still possible for a gentleman to do a gentleman’s part in '\n"," 'law.” Well, that wouldn’t do. He’d have to go deeper. He averted his eyes '\n"," 'from old Sam’s casual penetration and said, “Tough, yes. But there’s '\n"," 'something about law work . . .” He wondered if the old man would follow '\n"," 'this. “Look, Sam, did it ever occur to you that the law is the biggest thing '\n"," 'ever built? It’s bigger’n bridges, big^er’n buildings—because they’re all '\n"," 'built on it. A lawyer’s a part of the law, and the law is part of everything '\n"," 'else—everything we own, the way we run governments, everything we make and '\n"," 'carry and use. Ever think of that?” “Can’t say I did,” said Sam. “Tell me '\n"," 'something—the law, is it finished?” “Finished?” “What I mean, this rock '\n"," 'everything’s built on, how solid is it? Is it going to change much? Didn’t '\n"," 'it change a whole lot to get the way it is?” “Well sure! Everything changes '\n"," 'a lot while it’s growing up.” “Ah. It’s grown up.” “Don’t you think it has?” '\n"," 'O’Banion asked with sudden truculence. Sam grinned easily. “Shucks, boy, I '\n"," 'don’t think. I just ask questions. You were saying about ‘your sort of '\n"," 'people’: you think you-all belong in the law?” “Yes!” said O’Banion, and saw '\n"," 'immediately that Sam would not be satisfied with so little. “We do in this '\n"," 'sense,” he said earnestly. “All through the ages men have worked and built '\n"," 'and—and owned. And among them there rose a few who were bom and bred and '\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":[" 'trained to—to—” He took another drink, but it and the preceding liquor '\n"," 'seemed not to be helping him. He wanted to say to rule and he wanted to say '\n"," 'to own, but he had wit enough about him to recognize that Sam would '\n"," 'misunderstand. So he tried again. “Bom and bred to— live that—uh—way of life '\n"," 'I mentioned before. It’s to the interest of those few people to invest their '\n"," 'lives in things as they are, to keep them that way; in other words, to work '\n"," 'for and uphold the law.” He leaned back with a flourish that The (Widget), '\n"," 'The (Wadget) and Boff 181 somehow wasn’t as eloquent as he had hoped and '\n"," 'very nearly upset his glass to boot. “Don’t the law contradict itself once '\n"," 'in a while?” “Naturally!” O’Banion’s crystallizing concept of the nobility '\n"," 'of his work was beginning to intoxicate him more than anything else. “But '\n"," 'the very nature of our courts is a process of refinement, constant '\n"," 'purification.” He leaned forward excitedly. “Look, laws are dreams, when '\n"," 'they’re first thought of—inspirations! There’s something . . . uh . . . holy '\n"," 'about that, something beyond the world of men. And that’s why when the world '\n"," 'of men comes into contact with it, the wording of the inspiration has to be '\n"," 'redone in the books, or interpreted in the courtroom. That’s what we mean by '\n"," '‘precedents’ —that’s what the big dusty books are for, to create and '\n"," 'maintain consistency under the law.” “What about justice?” murmured Sam, and '\n"," 'then quickly, as if he hadn’t meant to change the subject, “That’s not what '\n"," 'I meant by contradictin’, counsellor. I mean all laws that all men have '\n"," 'dreamed up and lived by and got theirselves killed over. Tell me something, '\n"," 'counsellor, is there even one single law so right for men that it shows up '\n"," 'in every country that is or was?” O’Banion made a startled sound, as half a '\n"," 'dozen excellent examples flashed into his mind at once, collided, and, under '\n"," 'the first examination, faded away. “Because,” said Sam in a voice which was '\n"," 'friendly and almost apologetic, “if there ain’t such a law, you might say '\n"," 'every set of laws ever dreamed up, even the sets that were bigger and older '\n"," 'and lasted longer than the one you practice, even any set you can imagine '\n"," 'for the future—they’re all goin’ to contradict one another some way or '\n"," 'other. So, who’s really to say whose set of laws are right—or fit to build '\n"," 'anything on, or breed up a handful of folks fit to run it?” O’Banion stared '\n"," 'at his glass without touching it. For an awful moment he was totally '\n"," 'disoriented; a churning pit yawned under his feet and he must surely topple '\n"," 'ipto it. He thought wildly, you can’t leave me here, old man! You’d better '\n"," 'say something el§e, and fast, or I ... or I .. . There was a sort of '\n"," 'pressure in his ears, like sound too high-pitched for humans. Sam said '\n"," 'softly, “You really think Sue Martin ain’t good enough for you?” “I didn’t '\n"," 'say that, I didn’t say that!” O’Banion blurted, 182 Theodore Sturgeon hoarse '\n"," 'with indignation, and fright, and relief as well. He shuddered back and away '\n"," 'from the lip of this personal precipice and looked redly at the composed Old '\n"," 'face. “I said different, too different, that’s all. I’m thinking of her as '\n"," 'well as—” For once Sam bluntly interrupted, as if he had no patience with '\n"," 'what O’Banion was saying. “What’s different?” “Background, I told you. Don’t '\n"," 'you know what that is?” “You mean the closer a girl’s background is to '\n"," 'yours, the better chance you’d have bein’ happy the rest of your life?” '\n"," '“Isn’t it obvious?” The perfect example popped into his mind, and he speared '\n"," 'a finger out and downward toward the piano. “Did you hear what she was '\n"," 'singing just before you got here? ‘The boy next door.’ Don’t you understand '\n"," 'what that really means, why that song, that idea, hits home to so many '\n"," 'people? Everybody understands that; it’s the appeal of what’s familiar, '\n"," 'close by—the similar background I’m talking about!” “You have to shout?” '\n"," 'chuckled Sam. Sobering, he said, “Well, counsellor, if you’re goin’ to think '\n"," 'consistently, like you said, couldn’t you dream up a background even more '\n"," 'sim’lar than your next-door neighbor?” O’Banion stared at him blankly, and '\n"," 'old Sam Bittelman asked, “Are you an only child, counsellor?” O’Banion '\n"," 'closed his eyes and saw the precipice there waiting; he snapped them open in '\n"," 'sheer self-defense. His hands hurt and he looked down, and slowly released '\n"," 'them from the edge of the table, he whispered, “What are you trying to tell '\n"," 'me?” His bland face the very portrait of candor, Sam said, “Shucks, son, I '\n"," 'couldn’t tell you a thing, not a blessed thing Why, I don’t know anything '\n"," 'you don’t know to tell you! I ain’t asked you a single question you '\n"," 'couldn’t’ve asked yourself, and the answers were all yours, not mine. Hey . '\n"," '. he breathed, “you better come along home. You wouldn’t want Miz Martin to '\n"," 'see you looking the way you do right now.” Numbly, Anthony Dunglass O’Banion '\n"," 'followed him out. VIII It was hot, so hot that apparently even Bitty felt '\n"," 'it, and after supper went to sit on the verandah. It was very late 183 The '\n"," '(Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff when at last she came in to do the dishes, '\n"," 'but she went ahead without hurrying, doing her usual steady, thorough job. '\n"," 'Sam had gone to bed, Mary Haunt was sulking in her room after yet another of '\n"," 'those brief, violent brushes with Miss Schmidt. O’Banion was crouching '\n"," 'sWeatily over some law-books in the parlor, and Halvorsen— Halvorsen was '\n"," 'standing behind her, just inside the kitchen. On his face was a mixture of '\n"," 'expressions far too complicated to analyze, but simple in sum—a sort of '\n"," 'anxious wistfulness. In his hands was a paper sack, the mouth of which he '\n"," 'held as if it were full of tarantulas. His stance was peculiar, strained and '\n"," 'off-balance, one foot advanced, his shoulders askew; his resolution had '\n"," 'equated with his diffidence and immobilized him, and there he stayed like a '\n"," 'bee in amber. Bitty did not turn. She went rigfy: on working steadily, her '\n"," 'back to him, until she had finished the pot she was scouring. Still without '\n"," 'turning, she reached for another and said, “Well, come on in, Philip.” '\n"," 'Halvorsen literally sagged as her flat, matter-of-fact voice reached him, '\n"," 'shattering with its exterior touch his interior deadlock. He grinned, or '\n"," 'just bared his teeth, and approached her. “You do have eyes in the back of '\n"," 'your head.” “Nup.” She rapped once with her knuckle on the window-pane over '\n"," 'the sink. Night )iad turned it to black glass. Halvorsen watched the little '\n"," 'cone of suds her hand had left, then refocused his eyes on the image in the '\n"," 'glass—vivid, the kitchen and everything in it. Hoarsely, he said, “I’m '\n"," 'disappointed.” “I don’t keep things I don’t need,” she said bluntly, as if '\n"," 'they’d been talking about apple-corers. “What’s on your mind? Hungry?” “No.” '\n"," 'He looked down at his hands, tightened them still more on the bag. “No,” he '\n"," 'said again, “I have, I wanted . . .” He noticed that she had stopped working '\n"," 'and was standing still, inhumanly still, with her hands in the dishwater and '\n"," 'her eyes on the window-pane. “Turn around, Bitty.” When she would not, he '\n"," 'supported the bottom of the paper bag with one hand and with the other '\n"," 'scrabbled it open. He put his hand down inside it. “Please,” he tried to '\n"," 'say, but it was only a hiss. She calmly shook water off her hands, wiped '\n"," 'them on a paper towel. When she turned around her face was eloquent— 184 '\n"," 'Theodore Sturgeon as always, and only because it always was. Its lines were '\n"," 'eloquent, and the shape of her penetrating eyes, and the light in them. As a '\n"," 'photograph or a painting such a face is eloquent. It is a frightening thing '\n"," 'to look into one and realize for the first time that behind it nothing need '\n"," 'be moving. Behind the lines of wisdom and experience and the curved spoor of '\n"," 'laughter, something utterly immobile could be waiting. Only waiting. '\n"," 'Halvorsen said, “I think all the time.” He wet his lips. “I never stop '\n"," 'thinking, I don’t know how. It’s . . . there’s something wrong.” Flatly, '\n"," '“What’s wrong?” “You, Sam,” said Halvorsen with difficulty. He looked down '\n"," 'at the bag over his hand. She did not. “I’ve had the . . . feeling . . . for '\n"," 'a long time now. I didn’t know what it was. Jusf something wrong. So I '\n"," 'talked to O’Banion. Miss Schmidt too. Just, you know, talk.” He swallowed. '\n"," '“I found out. What’s wrong, I mean. It’s the way you and Sam talk to us, all '\n"," 'of us.” He gestured with the paper bag. “You never say anything! You only '\n"," 'ask questions!” “Is that all?” asked Bitty good-humoredly. “No,” he said, '\n"," 'his eyes fixed on hers. He stepped back a pace. “Aren’t you afraid that '\n"," 'paper bag’ll spoil your aim, Philip?” He shook his head. His face turned the '\n"," 'color of putty. “You didn’t go out and buy a gun just for me, did you?” “You '\n"," 'see?” he breathed. “Questions. You see?” “You already had it, didn’t you, '\n"," 'Philip? Bought it for something else?” “Stay away from me,” he whispered, '\n"," 'but she had not moved. He said, “Who are you? What are you after?” “Philip,” '\n"," 'she said gently—and now she smiled. “Philip— why do you want to be dead?\" '\n"," 'Part Two SPECIAL ENTRY IN FIELD EXPEDITION (NOTEBOOK) x: Since it is now '\n"," '(my) intention to prefer charges against (my) (partner-teammate) (Smith) and '\n"," 'to use these (notes) as a formal (document) in the matter, (I) shall now '\n"," 'summarize in detail the particulars of the case: (We) have been on Earth for '\n"," '(expression of time-units) on a field expedition to determine whether or not '\n"," 'the dominant species here possesses the Synapse known to our (catalog) as '\n"," 'Beta sub Sixteen, the master (computer) (at home) having concluded that '\n"," 'without the Synapse, this Earth culture must become extinct. Needless to '\n"," '(say) (we) are here to observe and not to interfere; to add to the '\n"," '(memory-banks) of the master (computer) only, it being a matter of no '\n"," 'significance otherwise. On arrival (we) set up the usual (detectors), '\n"," 'expecting to get our information in a (expression of very short time-unit) '\n"," 'or so; but to our (great astonishment) the readings on the (kickshaw), the '\n"," '(gimmick) and our high-sensitivity (sniwy) were mixed; it appeared that this '\n"," 'culture possessed the Synapse but did not use it. (! ! !) (We) therefore '\n"," 'decided to conduct a (microcosmic) observation on each of the specimens in a '\n"," 'small group, under (laboratory) conditions, to discover to what extent the '\n"," 'Synapse exists in them, and under what circumstances it might become '\n"," 'functional. We have set up for this purpose (the analog of) a ( ), or. '\n"," '(residence), called, in Terrestrial terms, small town boarding house, and '\n"," 'have attracted to it: philip halvorsen, a young vocational guidance expert, '\n"," 'who has a ceaselessly activa. analytical mind, and a kind of instinct for '\n"," 'illogic: he knows when a person or situation is, in some way, wrong, and '\n"," 'will not rest until he finds out why. He has recently followed his own logic '\n"," 'to the conclusion that he wants to be dead—and he can’t find out why! . . . '\n"," 'mary haunt, a beautiful girl who claims to be twenty-two (and lies), and who '\n"," 'wants to be a movie star with an ambition transcending all reason. She is '\n"," 'employed in a very minor capacity at the local radio station, and is always '\n"," 'angry at everyone. . . . Anthony dunglass o’banion, young lawyer, deeply '\n"," 'convinced that his family background, “breeding,” “culture” and occupation '\n"," 'set him apart from everyone else in town; he is desperately fighting a '\n"," 'growing 185 186 Theodore Sturgeon conviction that he is in love with . . . '\n"," 'sue martin, young widowed night-club hostess (whom O’Banion’s Mother, if she '\n"," 'were here, would certainly refer to as a “woman of that sort”). Sue Martin, '\n"," 'a woman of unusual equilibrium, loves O’Banion but will not submit herself '\n"," 'to his snobbery and therefore keeps her feelings very much to herself. . . . '\n"," 'Her young son robin who is three, and is friends with everyone everywhere '\n"," 'including his invisible, “imaginary” playmates Boff and Googie. Robin’s '\n"," 'special friend is the lawyer O’Banion; they get along very well indeed. . . '\n"," '. Finally, miss schmidt, the high-school librarian, who is a soft-voiced, '\n"," 'timid little rabbit of a woman, afraid of the world and abjectly obedienr to '\n"," 'propriety. The retired couple who run the boarding house are sam and bitty '\n"," 'bittelman, wise, relaxed, helpful, observant. They are available always '\n"," 'except for one day a month when they go out “for a ride.” That, in '\n"," 'Terrestrial terms, is (our) laboratory setup. (We) installed a (widget) and '\n"," '(rigged-up) a (wadget) as complementary (observation-and-control) even '\n"," 'though it meant using a (miserable) (inefficient) (old-fashioned) power '\n"," 'supply on the (wadget), which has to be re (charged) every (equivalent of '\n"," 'Earth month). Everything proceeded satisfactorily until (Smith), plagued by '\n"," 'what (I),can only, in the most cosmic breadth of generosity, call an excess '\n"," 'of enthusiasm, insisted that (we) speed up our research by stimulating the '\n"," 'Synapse in these specimens. In spite of (my) warnings and (my) caution, (he) '\n"," '(bulled) ahead giving (me) no choice but to assist (him) in re (wiring) the '\n"," '(machines) for this purpose. But let it be on the (record) that (I) '\n"," 'specifically warned (him) of the dangers of revealing (our) presence here. '\n"," '(I) for (one) dread the idea of being responsible for the destruction of '\n"," 'organized life. Even if only one of the specimens should detect (us), there '\n"," 'is so much intercommunication in this small group that it would be virtually '\n"," 'impossible to remove or destroy one without alerting and disturbing all. The '\n"," 'least effect would be to negate all (four) efforts so far; the most is '\n"," 'something (I) cannot (ethically) live with. Under these (unhappy) '\n"," 'circumstances (we) proceeded with the stimulation: Old Sam Bittelman went to '\n"," 'Miss Schmidt’s room when she reported here Venetian blind broken and unable '\n"," 'to close. She suddenly found it impossible not to answer Sam’s questions, '\n"," 'which probed at the very roots of her timidity. Shocked to these roots, but '\n"," 'more thoughtful than she had ever been in her life before, she went to bed '\n"," 'forgetting the blind and thinking about the fact that her conditioning to '\n"," 'keep her body covered was more deeply instilled into her than Thou shall not '\n"," 'kill—and other, equally unsettling concepts. The (Widget), The (Wadget) and '\n"," 'Boff 187 Mary Haunt overslept, for the very first time, and went into the '\n"," 'kitchen, furious. Sam and Bitty were there, and suddenly th girl had to '\n"," 'answer the questions they shot at her. She escaped quickly, but spent the '\n"," 'rest of the day in bed, miserable and disoriented, wondering if, after all, '\n"," 'she did want Hollywood. . . . Anthony O’Banion went down to the night club '\n"," 'where Sue Martin worked, and sat out of sight on the balcony. Suddenly Sam '\n"," 'Bittelman was at the table with him, asking him deeply troubling questions '\n"," 'about the law and why he practiced it, about his convictions of blood and '\n"," 'breeding, and about his feelings for Sue Martin. Dizzied and speechless, '\n"," 'O’Banion was led home by kind old Sam. Bitty found Sue Martin alone in her '\n"," 'room one morning, and asked her some pointed questions, all of which Sue '\n"," 'answered with ease, quite undisturbed, quite willing. Yes, she loved '\n"," 'O’Banion. No, she wouldn’t do anything about it; that was O’Banion’s '\n"," 'problem. Sue Martin was no trouble at all to Bitty. . . . Late one hot '\n"," 'evening Halvorsen walked into the kitchen with a gun in his hand, saying '\n"," 'there was something wrong, something he couldn’t name . . . but “Who are you '\n"," 'and what do you want?” Bitty calmly asked him why he had bought a ghn: “It '\n"," 'was for yourself, wasn’t it, Philip? Why do you want to be dead?” (I) submit '\n"," 'that (Smith) is guilty of carelessness and (unethical) conduct. (I) see no '\n"," 'solution but to destroy this specimen and perhaps the others. (I) declare '\n"," 'that this situation has arisen only because (Smith) ignored (my) clearly '\n"," '(stated) warning. As,. (I) (write), this alerted, frightened specimen stands '\n"," 'ready to commit violence on (our) (equipment) and thereby itself. (I) hereby '\n"," 'serve notice on (Smith) that (he) got (us) into this and (he) can ( )ing '\n"," 'well get (us) out. IX “Why do you want to be dead?” Phil Halvorsen stood '\n"," 'gaping at the old woman, and the gun, still shrouded in its silly paper bag, '\n"," 'began whispering softly as he trembled. The butt fitted his hand as his hand '\n"," 'fitted the butt; It’s holding me, he thought hysterically, knowing clearly '\n"," 'that his hysteria was a cloud, a cloak, a defense against that which he was '\n"," 'not equipped to think about . . . well, maybe not ready to think about; but '\n"," 'how had she known? 188 Theodore Sturgeon For nearly two days he had been '\n"," 'worrying and gnawing at this sense of wrongness about him. Back and back he '\n"," 'would come to it, only to reach bafflement and kick it away angrily; not '\n"," 'eating enough, hardly sleeping at all; let me sleep first! something wailed '\n"," 'within him, and as he sensed it he kicked it away again: more hysteria, not '\n"," 'letting him think. And then a word from O’Banion, a phrase from Miss '\n"," 'Schmidt, and his own ragbag memory: The Bittelmans never said—they always '\n"," 'asked. It was as if they could reach into a man’s mind, piece together '\n"," 'questions from the unused lumber stored there, and from it build shapes he '\n"," 'couldn’t bear to look at. How many terrible questions have l locked away? '\n"," 'And has she broken the lock? He said, “Don’t. . . ask me that. . . why did '\n"," 'you ask me that?” “Well, why ever not?” “You’re a . . . you can read my '\n"," 'mind.” “Can I?” “Say something!” he shouted. The paper bag stopped '\n"," 'whispering. He thought she noticed it. “Am I reading your mind,” she asked '\n"," 'reasonably, “if I see you walk in here the way you did looking like the '\n"," 'wrath o’ God, holding that thing out in front of you and shying away from it '\n"," 'at the same time, and then tell you that if you accidentally pull the '\n"," 'trigger you might have to die for it? Read minds? Isn’t it enough to read '\n"," 'the papers?” Oh, he thought. . . . Oh-h. He looked at her sharply. She was '\n"," 'quite calm, waiting, leaving it to him. He knew, suddenly and certainly, '\n"," 'that this woman could outthink him, outtalk him, seven ways from Sunday '\n"," 'without turning a hair. This meant either that he was completely and '\n"," 'embarrassingly wrong, or that her easy explanations weren’t true ones . . . '\n"," 'which was the thing that had been bothering him in the first place. “Why did '\n"," 'you say I bought the gun for something else?” he snapped. She gave him that '\n"," 'brief, very-warm smile. “Didn’t say; I asked you, right? How could I really '\n"," 'know?” For one further moment he hesitated, and it came to him that if this '\n"," 'flickering doubt about her was justified, the chances were that a gun would '\n"," 'be as ineffective as an argument. And besides ... it was like a silent '\n"," 'current in the room, a sort of almost-sound, or the aural pressure he could '\n"," 'The (Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff 189 feel sometimes when a car was '\n"," 'braking near him; but here it came out feeling like comfort. He let the bag '\n"," 'fall until it swung from its mouth. He twisted it closed. “Will you—I mean,” '\n"," 'he bumbled, “I don’t want it.” “Now what would I do with a gun?” she asked. '\n"," '“I don’t know. I just don’t want it around. I can throw it away. I don’t '\n"," 'want to have anything to do with it. I thought maybe you could put it away '\n"," 'somewhere.” “You know, you’d better sit down,” said Bitty. She didn’t '\n"," 'exactly push him but he had to move back to get out of her way as she '\n"," 'approached, and when the back of his knees hit a chair he had to sit down or '\n"," 'fall down. Bitty continued across the kitchen, opened a high cupboard and '\n"," 'put the bag on the topmost shelf. “Only place in the house Robin can’t climb '\n"," 'into.” “Robin. Oh yes,” he said, seeing the possibilities. “I’m sorry. I’m '\n"," 'sorry.” “You’d better talk it out, Philip,” she said in her flat, kind way. '\n"," '“You’re fixing to bust wide open. I won’t have you messing up my kitchen.” '\n"," '“There’s nothing to talk about.” She paused on her Way back to the sink, in '\n"," 'a strange hesitation like one listening. Suddenly she turned and sat down at '\n"," 'the table with him. “What did you want with a gun, Philip?” she demanded; '\n"," 'and just as abruptly, he answered her, as if she had hurled something at him '\n"," 'and it had bounced straight back into her waiting hands, “I was thinking '\n"," 'about killing myself.” If he thought this would elicit surprise, or an '\n"," 'exclamation, or any more questions, he was disappointed. She seemed only to '\n"," 'be waiting, so he said, with considerably more care, “I don’t know why I '\n"," 'told you that but it came out right. I said I was thinking about doing it. I '\n"," 'didn’t say I was going to do it.” He looked at her. Not enough? Okay then: '\n"," '“I couldn’t be sure exactly what I was thinking until I bought a gun. Does '\n"," 'that make any sense to you?” “Why not?” “I don’t ever know exactly what I '\n"," 'think unless I try it out. Or get all the pieces laid out ready to try.” “Or '\n"," 'tell somebody?” “I couldn’t tell anybody about this.” 190 Theodore Sturgeon '\n"," '“Did you try?” “Damn it!” It was a whisper, but it emerged under frightening '\n"," 'pressure. Then normally, “I’m sorry, Bitty, I’m real sorry. I suddenly got '\n"," 'mad at the language, you know what I mean? You say something in words of one '\n"," 'syllable and it comes out meaning something you never meant. I told you, ‘I '\n"," 'couldn’t tell anybody about this.’ That sounds as if I knew all about it and '\n"," 'was just shy or something. So you ask me, ‘Did you try?’ But what I really '\n"," 'mean was that this whole thing, everything about it, is a bunch of—of '\n"," 'feelings and— well, crazy ideas that I couldn’t tell anyone about.” Bitty’s '\n"," 'rare smile flickered. “Did you try?” “Well I’ll be. You’re worse than ever,” '\n"," 'he said, this time without anger. “You do know what I’m thinking.” “So what '\n"," 'were you thinking?” He sobered immediately. “Things ... all crazy. I think '\n"," 'all the time, Bitty, like a radio was playing all day, all night, and I '\n"," 'can’t turn it off. Wouldn’t want to; wouldn’t know how to live without it. '\n"," 'Ask me is it going to rain and off I go, thinking about rain, where it comes '\n"," 'from, about clouds, how many different kinds there are; about air-currents '\n"," 'and jet-streams and everything else you pick up reading those little '\n"," 'paragraphs at the bottom of newspaper columns; about—” “About why you bought '\n"," 'a gun?” “Huh? Oh . . . all right, all right, I won’t ramble.” He closed his '\n"," 'eyes to hear his thoughts, and frowned at them. “Anyway, at the tail end of '\n"," 'these run-downs is always some single thing that stops the chain—for the '\n"," 'time. It might be the answer to some question I asked myself, or someone '\n"," 'asks me, or it might just be as far as the things I know will take me. “So '\n"," 'one day a few weeks ago I got to thinking about guns, and never mind the way '\n"," 'I went, but what I arrived at was the idea of a gun killing me, and then '\n"," 'just the idea of being dead. And the more I thought, the more scared I got.” '\n"," 'After waiting what seemed to be long enough, Bitty said, “Scared.” “It '\n"," 'wasn’t kil—being dead that scared me. It was the feeling I had about it. I '\n"," 'was glad about it. I wanted it. That’s what scared me.” “Why do you want to '\n"," 'be dead?” “That’s what I don’t know.” His voice fell. “Don’t know, 191 The '\n"," '(Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff I just d on’t know,” he mumbled. “So I '\n"," 'couldn’t get it out of my head and I couldn’t make any sense out of it, and '\n"," 'I thought the only thing I could do was to get a gun and load it and—get '\n"," 'everything ready, to see how I felt then.” He looked up at her. “That sounds '\n"," 'real crazy, I bet.” Bitty shrugged. Either she denied the statement or it '\n"," 'didn’t matter. Halvorsen looked down again and said to his clenched hands, '\n"," '“I sat there in my room with the muzzle in my mouth and all the safeties '\n"," 'off, and hooked my thumb around the trigger.” “Learn anything?” His mouth '\n"," 'moved but he couldn’t find words to fit the movement. “Well,” said Bitty '\n"," 'sharply, “why didn’t you pull it?” “I just—” He closed his eyes in one of '\n"," 'those long, inward-reading pauses. “—couldn’t. I mean, didn’t. I wasn’t '\n"," 'afraid, if that’s what you want to know.” He glanced at her and couldn’t '\n"," 'tell what she wahted to know. “Sitting there, that way, I came to realize '\n"," 'that this wasn’t the way it should happen,” he said with some difficulty. '\n"," '“What is the way?” “Like this: if ever there was an earthquake, or I looked '\n"," 'up and saw a safe falling on me, or some other thing like that, something '\n"," 'from outside myself—I wouldn’t move aside. I’d let it happen.” “Is there a '\n"," 'difference between that and shooting yourself?” “Yesl” he said, with more '\n"," 'animation than he had shown so far. “Put it like this: there’s part of me '\n"," 'that’s dead, and wants the rest of me dead. There’s part of me that’s alive, '\n"," 'and wants all of me alive.” He looked that over and nodded at it. “My hand, '\n"," 'my arm, my thumb on the trigger—they’re alive. All the live parts of me want '\n"," 'to help me go on living, d’you see? No live part should help the dead part '\n"," 'get what it wants. The way it’ll happen, the way it should happen, is not '\n"," 'when I do something to make it happen. It’ll be when I don’t do something. I '\n"," 'won’t get out of the way, and that’s it, and thanks for keeping the gun for '\n"," 'me, it’s no use to me.” He stood up and found his eyes locked with hers,\" '\n"," 'and sat right down again, breathing hard. “Why do you want to be dead?” she '\n"," 'asked flatly. He put his head down on his hands and began to rock it slowly '\n"," 'to and fro. 192 Theodore Sturgeon “Don’t you want to know?” Muffled, his '\n"," 'voice came up from the edge of the table. “No.” Abruptly he sat up, staring. '\n"," '“No? What made me say no? Bitty,” he demanded, “what made me say that?” She '\n"," 'shrugged. He jumped up and began pacing swiftly up and down the kitchen. '\n"," '“I’ll be dogged,” he murmured once, and “Well, what d’ye kn—” Bitty watched '\n"," 'him, and catching him on a turn when their eyes could meet, she asked, '\n"," '“Well,—why do you want to—” “Shut up,” he said. He said it, not to her, but '\n"," 'to any interruption. His figmentary signal-light, which indicated '\n"," 'dissatisfaction, unrightness, was casting its glow all over his interior '\n"," 'landscape. To be hounded half to death by something like this, then to '\n"," 'discover that basically he didn’t want to investigate it. . . . He sat down '\n"," 'and faced her, his eyes alight. “I don’t know yet,” he said, “but I will, I '\n"," 'will.” He took a deep breath. “It’s like being chased by something that’s '\n"," 'gaining on you, and you duck into an alley, and then you find it’s blind, '\n"," 'there’s only a brick wall; so you sit down to wait, it’s all you can do. And '\n"," 'all of a sudden you find a door in the wall. Been there all the time. Just '\n"," 'didn’t look.” “Why do you want fo be dead’*- “B-because I—I shouldn’t be '\n"," 'alive. Because the average guy—Different, that’s what I am, different, '\n"," 'unfit.” “Different, unfit.” Bitty’s eyebrows raised slightly. “They the same '\n"," 'thing, Philip?” “Well, sure.” “You can’t jump like a kangaroo, you can’t eat '\n"," 'grass raw like a cow—different. You unfit because you can’t do those '\n"," 'things?” He made an annoyed laugh. “Not that, not that. People, I mean.” '\n"," '“You can’t fly a plane. You can’t sing like Sue Martin. You can’t spout law '\n"," 'like Tony O’Banion. That kind of different?” “No,” he said, and in a surge '\n"," 'of anguish, “No, no! I can’t talk about it, Bitty!” He looked at her and '\n"," 'again saw that rare, deep smile. He answered it in kind, but weakly, '\n"," 'remembering that he had said that to her before. “This time I mean I can’t '\n"," 'talk about such things to you. To a lady,” he said in abrupt, unbearable '\n"," 'confusion. 193 The (Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff “I’m no lady,” said Bitty '\n"," 'with conviction. Suddenly she punched his forearm; he thought it was the '\n"," 'first time she had ever touched him. “To you I’m not even a human being. Not '\n"," 'even another person. I mean it,” she said warmly. “Have I asked you a single '\n"," 'question you couldn’t’ve asked yourself? Have I told you anything you didn’t '\n"," 'know?” His peculiar linear mind cast rapidly back and up again. He felt an '\n"," 'odd instant of disorientation. It was not unpleasant. Bitty said gently, “Go '\n"," 'on talking to yourself, boy. Who knows—you might find yourself in good '\n"," 'company.” “Aw . . . thanks, Bitty,”, he mumbled. His eyes stung and he shook '\n"," 'his head. “All right, all right, then ... it just came to me, one big flash, '\n"," 'and I guess I couldn’t sit here—here,” he said, waving his arm to include '\n"," 'the scrubbed, friendly kitchen, “and look at you, and think about these—uh '\n"," 'this— all at once.” He swallowed heavily. “Well, that time I told you about, '\n"," 'that day I found out I wanted to be dead, it was like getting hit on the '\n"," 'head. Right after that, only a couple of minutes, I got hit on the head just '\n"," 'as hard by something else. I didn’t know—want to know till now that they '\n"," 'were connected, some way.” He closed his eyes. “It was a theater, that '\n"," 'rathole down across the Circle. You know. It—it hit out at me when I wasn’t '\n"," 'looking. It was all covered with . . . pictures and—and it said SEE this and '\n"," 'SEE that and SEE some dirty other thing, adults only, you know what I mean.” '\n"," 'He opened his eyes to see what Bitty was doing, but Bitty was doing nothing '\n"," 'at all. Waiting. He turned his face away from her, and said indistinctly '\n"," 'into his shoulder, “All my life those things meant nothing to me. There!” he '\n"," 'shouted, “you see? Different, different!” But she wouldn’t see. Or she '\n"," 'would’t see until he did, himself, more clearly. She still waited. He said, '\n"," '“Down at work, there’s a fellow, Scodie. This Scodie, he’s a good man, '\n"," 'really can turn out a day’s work. I mean, he likes what he’s doing, he '\n"," 'cares. Except every time a girl goes by, everything stops. He snaps up out '\n"," 'of what he’s doing, he watches her. I mean, every time. It’s like he can’t '\n"," 'help himself. He does it the way a cadet salutes an officer on the street. '\n"," 'He does it like that crossing-guard on the toy train, that pops out of his '\n"," 'little house every time his little light goes on. He watches until the '\n"," 'girl’s gone 194 Theodore Sturgeon by, and then he says ‘mmmyuh!’ and looks '\n"," 'over at me and winks.” “What do you do, every time?” “Well, I—” He laughed '\n"," 'uncertainly. “I guess I wink back at him and I say, mm-hm! But I know why I '\n"," 'do it, it’s because he expects me to; he’d think it was sort of peculiar if '\n"," 'I didn’t. But he doesn’t do it for me; I don’t expect anything of him one '\n"," 'way or the other. He does it—” Words failed him, and he tried again. “Doing '\n"," 'that, he’s part of—everybody. What he does is the same thing every song on '\n"," 'every radio says every minute. Every ad in every magazine does it if it '\n"," 'possibly can, even if it means a girl in her underwear with stillson '\n"," 'wrenches for sale.” He leapt to his feet and began to pace excitedly. “You '\n"," 'got to back off a little to see it,” he told Bitty, who smiled behind his '\n"," 'back. “You got to look at the whole thing all at once, to see how much there '\n"," 'is of it, the jokes people tell—yeah, you got to laugh at them, whatever, '\n"," 'you even have to know a couple, or they’ll . . .-The window displays, the '\n"," 'television, the movies . . . somebody’s writing an article about transistors '\n"," 'or termites or something, and every once in a while he figures he’s been '\n"," 'away from it long enough and he has to say something about the birds and the '\n"," 'bees and ‘Gentlemen prefer.’ Everywhere you turn the whole world’s at it, '\n"," 'chipping and chipping away at it—” He stamped back to the table and looked '\n"," 'into Bitty’s face intently. “You got to back away and look at it all at '\n"," 'once,” he cautioned again. “I’m not in kindergarten, I know what it’s all '\n"," 'about. I’m not a woman-hater. I’ve been in love. I’ll get married, some day. '\n"," 'Go ahead and tell me I’m talking about one of the biggest, strongest, '\n"," 'down-deep urges we have—I’ll buy that. That’s what I mean, that’s what I’m '\n"," 'talking about.” His forehead was pink and shiny; he took out a crumpled '\n"," 'handkerchief and batted at it. “So much of it, all around you, all the time, '\n"," 'filling a big hungry need in average people. I don’t mean the urge itself; I '\n"," 'mean all this reminding, this what do you call it, indoctrination. It’s a '\n"," 'need or folks wouldn’t stand for so much of it, comic books, lipstick, that '\n"," 'air-jet in the floor at the funny-house at the Fair.” He thumped into his '\n"," 'chay*, panting. “Do you begin to see what I mean about ‘different’?” 195 The '\n"," '(Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff “Do you?” asked Bitty, but Halvorsen didn’t '\n"," 'hear her; he was talking again. “Different, because I don’t feel that hunger '\n"," 'to be reminded, I don’t need all that high-pressure salesmanship, I don’t '\n"," 'want it. Every time I tell one of my jokes, every time I wink back at old '\n"," 'Scodie, I feel like a fool, like some sort of a liar. But you got to protect '\n"," 'yourself; you can’t ever let anyone find out. You know why? Because the '\n"," 'average guy, the guy-by-the-millions that needs all that noise so much, '\n"," 'he’ll let you be the way he is, or he’ll let you be . . . I’m sorry, Bitty. '\n"," 'Don’t make me go into a lot of dirty details. You see what I mean, don’t '\n"," 'you?” “What do you mean?” ^ Irritated, he blew a single sharp blast from his '\n"," 'nostrils. “Well, what I mean is, they’ll let you be the way they are, or you '\n"," 'have to be . . . sick, crippled. You can’t be anything else! You can’t be '\n"," 'Phil Halvorsen who isn’t sick and who isn’t crippled but who just doesn’t '\n"," 'naturally go around banging his antlers against the rocks so the whole world '\n"," 'can hear it.” “So—that’s what you mean by unfit?” “That’s why I wanted to be '\n"," 'dead. I just don’t think the way other people do; if I act the way other '\n"," 'people do I feel . . . feel guilty. I guess I had this piling up in me for '\n"," 'years, and that day with the guns, when I found out what I wanted to do . . '\n"," '. and then that theater-front, yawping over me like a wet mouth full of '\n"," 'dirty teeth . . .” He giggled foolishly. “Listen to me, will you . . . '\n"," 'Bitty, I’m sorry.” She utterly ignored this. “High-pressure salesmanship,” '\n"," 'she said. “What?” “You said it, I didn’t. . . . Isn’t hunger one of those '\n"," 'big deep needs, Philip? Suppose you had a bunch of folks starving on an '\n"," 'island and dropped them a ton of food—would they need high-pressure '\n"," 'salesmanship?” It was as if he stood at the edge of a bottomless hole— more, '\n"," 'the very outer edge of the world, so close his very toes projected over the '\n"," 'emptiness. It filled him with wonder; he was startled, but not really '\n"," 'afraid, because it might well be that to fall down and down into that '\n"," 'endless place might be a very peaceful thing. He closed his eyes and slowly, '\n"," 'very slowly, came back to reality, the kitchen, Bitty, 196 Theodore Sturgeon '\n"," 'Bitty’s words. “You mean . . . the av—the ordin—you mean, people aren’t '\n"," 'really interested?” “Not that interested.” He blinked; he felt as if he had '\n"," 'ceased to exist in his world and had been plunked down in a very similar, '\n"," 'but totally new one. It was far less lonely here. He hit the table and '\n"," 'laughed into Bitty’s calm face. “I’m going to sleep,” he said, and got up; '\n"," 'and he knew she had caught his exact shade of meaning when she said gently, '\n"," '“Sure you can.” excerpt from field expedition (notebook) (I) had thought up '\n"," 'to now that in (Smith)’s (immorally) excessive enthusiasm and '\n"," '(bullheadedness) (I) had encountered the utmost in (irritants).

The sky was brass all day, and at night, '\n"," 'for want of ambition, the overcast was no more than a gauzy hood of haze. '\n"," '197 The (Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff It was the Bittelmans’ “day off” '\n"," 'again, and without them the spine had been snatched out of the household. '\n"," 'The boarders ate pokily, lightly, at random, and somehow got through the '\n"," 'time when there was nothing to do but sit up late enough to get tired enough '\n"," 'to get whatever rest the temperature would permit. It was too hot, even, to '\n"," 'talk, and no one attempted it. They drifted to their rooms to wait for '\n"," 'sleep; they slumped in front of fans and took cold showers which generated '\n"," 'more heat than they dissipated. When at last darkness came, it was a relief '\n"," 'only to the eyes. The household pulse beat slowly and slower; by eight '\n"," 'o’clock it was library-quiet, by nine quite silent, so that the soft '\n"," 'brushing of knuckles on Miss Schmidt’s door struck her like a shout. “Wh-who '\n"," 'is it?” she quavered, when she recovered her breath. “Sue.” “Oh—oh. Oh, do '\n"," 'come in.” She pulled the damp sheet tight up against her throat. “Oh, you’re '\n"," 'in bed already. I’m sorry.” “I’m sorry. It’s all right.” Sue Martin swung '\n"," 'the door shut and came all the way in. She was wearing an off-the-shoulder '\n"," 'peasant blouse and a plated skirt with three times more filmy nylon in it '\n"," 'than one would guess until she turned, when it drifted like smoke. “My,” '\n"," 'said Miss Schmidt enviously. “You look cool.” “State of mind,” Sue smiled. '\n"," '“I’m about fo go to work and I wish I didn’t have to.” . “And Bitty’s out. '\n"," 'I’m honorary baby-sitter again.” “You’re an angel.” “No, oh, no!” cried Miss '\n"," 'Schmidt. “I wish everything I had to do was that easy. Why, in all the time '\n"," 'I’ve known you, every time I’ve done it, I—I’ve had nothing to do!” “He '\n"," 'sleeps pretty soundly.

Sometimes he laughs out '\n"," 'loud,” said Sue Martin. “I was a little worried tonight, for a while. He was '\n"," 'so flushed and wide-awake—” * “Well, it’s hot.” “It wasn’t that.” Sue '\n"," 'chuckled. “His precious Boff was all over the place, ‘fixin’ things,” Robin '\n"," 'said. What he was 198 Theodore Sturgeon fixing all over the walls and '\n"," 'ceiling, Robin didn’t say. Whatever it was, it’s finished now, though, and '\n"," 'Robin’s sound asleep. I’m sure you won’t even have to go in. And Bitty ought '\n"," 'to be home soon.” “You’ll leave your door open?” Sue Martin nodded and '\n"," 'glanced up at the large open transom over Miss Schmidt’s door. “You’ll hear '\n"," 'him if he so much as blinks. . . . I’ve got to run. Thanks so much.” * “Oh, '\n"," 'really, Mrs. M—uh, Sue. Don’t thank me. Just run along.” “Good night.” Sue '\n"," 'Martin slipped out, silently closing the door behind her. Miss Schmidt '\n"," 'sighed and looked up at the transom. After Sue’s light footsteps had faded '\n"," 'away, she listened, listened as hard as she could, trying to pour part of '\n"," 'herself through the transom, across the hall, through Sue Martin’s open '\n"," 'door. A light sleeper at any time, she knew confidently that she was on '\n"," 'guard now and would wake if anything happened. If she slept at all in this '\n"," 'sticky heat. She might sleep, at that, she thought after a while. She '\n"," 'shifted herself luxuriously, and edged to a slightly cooler spot on the bed. '\n"," '“That wicked Sam,” she murmured, and blushed in the dark. But he had been '\n"," 'right; A nightgown in weather like this? Suddenly, she slept. In O’Banion’s '\n"," 'room, there was a soft sound. He had put off taking a shower until suddenly '\n"," 'he had used up his energy, and could hardly stir. I’ll just rest my eyes, he '\n"," 'thought, and bowed his head. The soft sound was made by his forehead '\n"," 'striking the book. Halvorsen lay rigid on his bed, staring at the ceiling. '\n"," 'There, almost as if it was projected, was the image of a flimsy cylinder '\n"," 'vomiting smoke. Go ahead, he thought, detachedly. Or go away. I don’t care '\n"," 'which. Before I talked to Bitty, I wanted you. Now, I don’t care. Is that '\n"," 'better? He closed his eyes, but the image was still there. He lay very '\n"," 'quietly, watching the insides of his eyelids. It was like being asleep. When '\n"," 'he was asleep the thing was there too. Mary Haunt sat by her window, '\n"," 'pretending it was cooler there than in bed. There was no anger in her, just '\n"," 'now as she lay back and dreamed. The Big Break, the pillars of light at her '\n"," 'premiere, her name two stories tall over a Broadway 199 The (Widget), The '\n"," '(Wadget) and Boff marquee—these had no place in this particular favorite '\n"," 'dream. I’ll do over Mom’s room, she thought, dimity, this time, and full, '\n"," 'full skirts on the vanity and the night table. She closed her eyes, putting '\n"," 'herself in Mom’s room with such vividness that she could almost smell the '\n"," 'cool faint odor of lavender sachets and the special freshness of sheets '\n"," 'dried in the sun. Yes, and something else, outside the ro om, barely, just '\n"," 'barely she knew bread was baking, so that the kitchen would be heavenly with '\n"," 'it; the bread would dominate the spice-shelf for a while, until it was out '\n"," 'of the oven and cooled. “Oh, Mom . . .” she whispered. She lay still in her '\n"," 'easy-chair, holding and holding to the vision until this room, this house, '\n"," 'this town didn’t matter any more. Some hours went by. Robin floated in a '\n"," 'luminous ocean of sleep where there was nothing to fear and where, if he '\n"," 'just turned to look, there were love and laughter waiting for him. His left '\n"," 'hand uncurled and he thrust the second and third fingers together into his '\n"," 'mouth. Somehow he was a big bulldozer with a motor that sounded like Mitster '\n"," 'and tracks that clattered along like Coffeepot, and Boff and Googie were '\n"," 'riding along with -him and laughing. Then without effort he was a glittery '\n"," 'ferris-wheel, but he could watch himself too in one of the cars, screaming '\n"," 'his delight and leaning against Tonio’s hard arm. All this, yet he was still '\n"," 'afloat in that deep bright place where there was no fear, where love and '\n"," 'laughter hid around some indescribable corner, waiting. Bright, brighter. '\n"," 'Warm, warm, warmer . . . oh, hot, hot! xi\\\\ Miss Schmidt opened her eyes to '\n"," 'an impossible orange glare and a roar like the end of the world. For one '\n"," 'full second she lay still, paralyzed by an utter disbelief; no light could '\n"," 'have become so bright, no sound could have risen to this volume, without '\n"," 'waking her as it began. Then she found a way to focus her eyes against that '\n"," 'radiance, and saw the flames, and in what was left to her of her immobile '\n"," 'second, she explained the whole thing to herself and said relievedly, of '\n"," 'course, of course: it’s only a nightmare and suppose there’s a fire?—and '\n"," 'that’s so silly, Sam— And then she was out of bed in a single bound, '\n"," 'standing in 200 Theodore Sturgeon the center of the room, face to flaming '\n"," 'face with reality. Everything was burning—everything! The drapes had already '\n"," 'gone and the slats of the Venetian blind, their cords gone, were heaped on '\n"," 'the floor, going like a campfire. Even as she watched the screen sagged and '\n"," 'crumpled, its pine frame glaring and spitting pitch through blistering '\n"," 'paint. It fell outside. Outside, outside! The window’s open, you’re on the '\n"," 'ground floor; yes, and there on the chair, not burning yet, your bathrobe; '\n"," 'take the robe and jump, quick! Then, beyond belief, there was a sound louder '\n"," 'than the earth-filling roar, and different; fine hot powder and a hot hail '\n"," 'of plaster showered on her shoulders; she looked up to see the main beam, '\n"," 'right over her head, sag toward her and hang groaning, one part reaching to '\n"," 'the other with broken flat fingers of splintered wood which gloved '\n"," 'themselves in flame as she saw them. She cowered, and just then the handle '\n"," 'of the door turned and a gout of smoke slammed it open and whisked out of '\n"," 'sight in the updraft; and there in the hall stood Robin, grinding a fat '\n"," 'little fist into one abruptly wakened eye. She could see his lips move, '\n"," 'though she could hear nothing in this mighty bellow of sound. She knew it, '\n"," 'though, and heard it clearly in her mind: “What’s ’at noice?” The beam '\n"," 'overhead grumbled and again she was showered with plaster. She batted it off '\n"," 'her shoulders, and whimpered. A great flame must have burst from the roof '\n"," 'above her just then, for through the window she saw a brilliant glare '\n"," 'reflected from the white clapboards of the garage wall outside. The glare '\n"," 'tugged at her—jump!—and besides, her robe . . . The beam thundered and began '\n"," 'to fall. Now she must make a choice, in microseconds. The swiftest thought '\n"," 'would not be fast enough to weigh and consider and decide; all that could '\n"," 'matter now was what was inside her, throwing switches (some so worn and easy '\n"," 'to move!). A giant was throwing them, and he was strong; his strength was a '\n"," 'conditioning deeper than thou shalt not kill; he was a lesson learned before '\n"," 'she had learned to love God, or to walk, or to talk. He was her mother’s '\n"," 'authority and the fear of all the hairy, sweaty, dangerous mysteries from '\n"," 'which she had shielded herself all her life; and his name and title were '\n"," 'Cover Thyself! With him, helping him, was the reflexive Save Thyself! and '\n"," 'against these—Robin, whom she loved (but love is The (Widget), The (Wadget) '\n"," 'and Boff 201 what she felt, once, for a canary, and once for a Raggedy Ann '\n"," 'doll) and her sense of duty to Sue Martin (but so lightly promised, and at '\n"," 'the time such a meaningless formality). There could be no choice in such a '\n"," 'battle, though she must live with the consequences for all her years. Then— '\n"," '—it was as if a mighty voice had called Stop!, and the very flames froze. '\n"," 'Half a foot above her hung the jagged end of the burning beam, and chunks of '\n"," 'plaster, splinters and scraps of shattered lath and glowing joist stopped in '\n"," 'midair. Yet during this sliver of a fraction of time, she knew that the '\n"," 'phenomenon was a mental something, a figment, and the idea of time-cessation '\n"," 'only a clumsy effort of her mind’s to account for what was happening. Save '\n"," 'Thyself was still there, hysterical hands clutching for the controls, but '\n"," 'Cover Thyself disappeared into the background. Save herself she would, but '\n"," 'it would be on new terms. She was in the grip of a reflex of reflexes, one '\n"," 'which took into consideration all the factors a normal reflex would, to the '\n"," 'end goal of survival. But along with these, it called up everything Reta '\n"," 'Schmidt had ever done, everything she had been. In a single soundless flash, '\n"," 'a new kind of light was thrown into every crevice and cranny of her '\n"," 'existence. It was her total self now, reacting to a total situation far '\n"," 'wider- than that which obtained here in this burning room. It illuminated '\n"," 'even the future—that much of it which depended upon these events, between '\n"," 'them and the next probable major “crossroads.” It cancled past misjudgments '\n"," 'and illogics and replaced them with rightness, even for the times she had '\n"," 'known what was right and had done otherwise. It came and was gone even while '\n"," 'she leaped, while she took two bounding steps across the floor and the beam '\n"," 'crashed and crushed and showered sparks where she had been standing. She '\n"," 'scooped up the child and ran down the hall, through the foyer, into the '\n"," 'kitchen. It was dark there, thick with swirling smoke, but the glass panels '\n"," 'on the kitchen door glared with some unfamiliar light from outdoors. She '\n"," 'began to cough violently, but grimly aimed at the light and drove ahead. It '\n"," 'was eclipsed suddenly by a monstrous shadow, and suddenly it exploded '\n"," 'inward. There were lights out there she had never seen before, and '\n"," 'half-silhouetted in the broken doorway was a big man with a gleaming helmet '\n"," 'and anaxe. 202 Theodore Sturgeon She tried to call, or perhaps it was only a '\n"," 'scream, but instead she went into a spasm of coughing. “Somebody in here?” '\n"," 'asked the man. A beam of light, apparently from the street, lit up the '\n"," 'shield on the front of his helmet as he leaned forward. He stepped inside. '\n"," '“Whew! Where are you?” She went blindly to him and pushed Robin against his '\n"," 'coat. “The baby,” she croaked. “Get him out of this smokef.” He grunted and '\n"," 'suddenly Robin was gone from her arms. “You all right?” He was peering into '\n"," 'the black and the smoke. “Take him out, she said. “Then I’ll want your '\n"," 'coat.” He went out. Miss Schmidt could hear Robin’s clear voice: “You a '\n"," 'fireman?” “I sure am,” rumbled the man. “Want to see my fire engine? Then '\n"," 'sit right there on the grass and wait one second. Okay?” “Okay.” The coat '\n"," 'flew through the doorway. , “Got it?” “Thank you.” She put the huge garment '\n"," 'on and went out. The fireman waited there, again holding Robin in his arms. '\n"," '“You all right, ma’am?” Her lungs were an agony and she had bums on her feet '\n"," 'and shoulders. Her hair was singed and one of her hands was flayed across '\n"," 'its back. “I’m just fine,” she said. They began to walk up the road. Robin '\n"," 'squirmed around in the man’s arms and popped his head out to look back at '\n"," 'the brightly burning house. “ ’By, Boff, he said happily, and then gave his '\n"," 'heart to the fire engine. XII “Mother, the bread’s burning!” Mary Haunt '\n"," 'opened her eyes to an impossible glare and a great roaring. She shriekecf '\n"," 'and flailed out blindly, as if she could frighten it away, whatever it was; '\n"," 'and then she came enough to her senses to realize that she still sat in her '\n"," 'chair by the window, and that the house was on fire. She leaped to her feet, '\n"," 'sending the heavy chair skittering across the 203 The (Widget), The (Wadget) '\n"," 'and Boff room where it toppled over against the clothespress. As it always '\n"," 'did when it was bumped, the clothespress calmly opened its doors. But Mary '\n"," 'Haunt didn’t wait for that or anything else. She struck the screen with the '\n"," 'flat of her hand. It popped out easily, and she hit the ground almost at the '\n"," 'same time as it did. She ran off a few steps, and then, like Lot’s wife, '\n"," 'curiosity overtook her and she stopped. She turned around in fascination. '\n"," 'Great wavering flames leapt fifty and sixty feet in the air and all the '\n"," 'windows were alight. From the town side she could hear the shriek and clang '\n"," 'of fire engines, and windows and doors opening, and running feet. But the '\n"," 'biggest sound of all was the roar of the fire, like a giant’s blowtorch. She '\n"," 'looked back at her own window. She could see into the room easily, the chair '\n"," 'on its side, the bed with its chenille top-spread sprouting measles of spark '\n"," 'and char, and the gaping doors of the—“My clothes! My clothes!” Furiously '\n"," 'she ran back to the window, paused a moment in horror to see fire run along '\n"," 'the picture-molding of the inside wall like a nightmare caterpillar. “My '\n"," 'clothes,” she whispered. She didn’t make much money at her job, but every '\n"," 'cent that wasn’t used in bed and board went on her back. She mouthed '\n"," 'something, and from her throat came that animal growl of hers; she put both '\n"," 'hands on the sill and leaped, and tumbled back into the house. She was '\n"," 'prepared for the heat but not for that intensity of light, and the noise was '\n"," 'worst of all. She recoiled from it and stood for a moment with her hands '\n"," 'over her eyes, swaying with the impact of it. Then she ground her teeth and '\n"," 'made her way across to the clothespress. She swept open the bottom drawer '\n"," 'and turned out the neatly folded clothes. Down at the bottom was a cotton '\n"," 'print dress, wrapped carefully around a picture frame. She lifted it out and '\n"," 'hugged it, and ran across to the window with it. She leaned far out and '\n"," 'dropped it gently on the grass, then turned back in again. The far wall, by '\n"," 'the door, began fo buckle high up, and suddenly there was fire up there. The '\n"," 'comer near the ceiling toppled into the room with a crash and a cloud of '\n"," 'white dust and greasy-looking smoke, and then the whole wall fell, Theodore '\n"," 'Sturgeon 204 not toward her, but away, so that her room now included a '\n"," 'section of the corridor outside. As the dust settled somebody, a man, came '\n"," 'roaring inarticulately and battering through the rubble. She could not know '\n"," 'who it was. He apparently meant to travel the corridor whether it was all '\n"," 'there or not, and he did, disappearing again into the inferno. She staggered '\n"," 'back toward the clothespress. She felt mad, drunk, crazy. Maybe it was the '\n"," 'de-oxygenated atmosphere and maybe it was fear and reaction, but it was sort '\n"," 'of wonderful, too; she felt her face writhing and part of her was numb with '\n"," 'astonishment at what the rest of her was doing: she was laughing. She '\n"," 'slammed into the clothespress, gasping for breath, filled her lungs and '\n"," 'delivered up a shrill peal of laughter. Almost helpless from it, she fumbled '\n"," 'down a dull satin evening gown with a long silver sash. She held it up in '\n"," 'front of her and laughed again, doubling over it, and then straightened up, '\n"," 'rolling the dress up into a ball as she did so. With all her might she '\n"," 'hurled it into the rubble of the hallway. Next was a simple black dress with '\n"," 'no back and a little bolero; with an expression on her face that can only be '\n"," 'described as cheerful, she threw it after the evening gown. Then the blue, '\n"," 'and the organdy with the taffeta underskirt, and the black and orange one '\n"," 'she used to call her Hallowe’en dress; each one she dragged out, held up, '\n"," 'and hurled: “You,” she growled between her convulsions of laughter, “you, '\n"," 'and you, and you.” When the press was empty, she ran to the bureau and '\n"," 'snatched open her scarf drawer, uncovering a flowerbed of dainty, filmy silk '\n"," 'and nylon and satin shawls, scarves, and kerchiefs. She whipped out an '\n"," 'over-sized babushka, barely heavier than the air that floated it, and ran '\n"," 'with it to the flaming mass where her door once was. She dipped and turned '\n"," 'like a dancer, fluttering it through flame, and when it was burning she '\n"," 'bounded back to the bureau and put it in the drawer with the others. Fire '\n"," 'streamed out of the drawer and she laughed and laughed . . . And something '\n"," 'nipped her sharply on the calves; she yelped and turned and found the lace '\n"," 'of her black negligee was on fire. She twisted back and gathered the cloth '\n"," 'and ripped it away. The pain had sobered her and she was bewildered now, '\n"," 'weak and beginning to be frightened. She started for the window and tripped '\n"," 'and fell heavily, and The (Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff 205 when she got '\n"," 'up the smoke was suddenly like a scalding blanket over her head and '\n"," 'shoulders and she didn’t know which way to go. She knelt and peered and '\n"," 'found the window in an unexpected direction, and made for. it. As she '\n"," 'tumbled through, the ceiling behind her fell, and the roof after it. \\\\ On '\n"," 'her belly she clawed away from the house, sobbing, and at last rose to her '\n"," 'knees. She smelt of smoke and burned hair and all her lovely fingernails '\n"," 'were broken. She squatted on the ground, staring at the flaming shell of the '\n"," 'house, and cried like a little girl. But when her swollen eyes rested on '\n"," 'that square patch in the grass, she stopped crying and got up and limped '\n"," 'over to it. Her cotton print, and the picture . . . she picked the tidy '\n"," 'package up and went tiredly away with it into the shadows where the hedge '\n"," 'met the garage. xm O’Banion raised his head groggily from the flyleaf of his '\n"," 'Blackstone and the neat inscription written there: The law doth punish man '\n"," 'or woman That steals the goose from off the common, But let the greater '\n"," 'felon loose, That steals the common from the goose, —a piece of Eighteenth '\n"," 'Century japery which O’Banion deplored. However, it had been written there '\n"," 'by Opdycke when he was in law school, and the Opdykes were a dam fine '\n"," 'family. Princeton people, of course, but nobody minded. All this flickered '\n"," 'through his mind as he swam up out of sleep, along with “What’s the matter '\n"," 'with my head?” because any roaring that loud must be in his ears; it would '\n"," 'be too incredible anywhere else, and “What’s the matter with the light?” '\n"," 'Then he was fully awake, and on his feet. “My God!” He ran to the door and '\n"," 'snatched it open. Flame squirted at him as if from a hose; in a split second '\n"," 'he felt his eyebrows disappear. He yelled and staggered back from it, and it '\n"," 'pursued him. He turned and dove out the window, landing clumsily on his '\n"," 'stomach with his fists clenched over 206 Theodore Sturgeon his solar plexus. '\n"," 'His own weight drove the fists deep, and for a full minute he lay groaning '\n"," 'for air. At last he got up, shook himself, and pelted around the house to '\n"," 'the front. One fire engine was already standing by the curb. There was a '\n"," 'police car and the knot of bug-eyed spectators who spring apparently out of '\n"," 'the ground at the scene of any accident anywhere at any hour. At the far end '\n"," 'of the Bittel-man lot, there was a sharp scream of rubber and a glare of '\n"," 'lights as a taxicab pulled in as close to the police barrier as it could '\n"," 'get. The door was already open; a figure left it, half running, half thrown '\n"," 'out by the sudden stop. “Sue!” But no one heard him—everyone else was '\n"," 'yelling too: “Look!” “Somebody stop her!” “Hey!” “Hey, you!” O’Banion backed '\n"," 'off a little to cup his hands and yell again, when directly over his head a '\n"," 'cheerful small voice said, “Mommy runs fast!” “Robin! You’re all right—” He '\n"," 'was perched on top of the fire engine with one arm around the shining brass '\n"," 'bell, looking like a Botticelli seraph. Someone beside him— good heavens, it '\n"," 'was Miss Schmidt, disheveled and brighteyed, wrapped up in some tentlike '\n"," 'garment—Miss Schmidt screamed, “Stop her, stop her, I’ve got the baby here!” '\n"," 'Robin said to Miss Schmidt, “Tonio runs fast too, shall we?” Now they were '\n"," 'all yelling at O’Banion, but in four paces he could hear nothing but the '\n"," 'roar ahead of him. He had never seen a house burn like this, all over, all '\n"," 'at once. He took the porch steps in one bound and had just time to turn his '\n"," 'shoulder to the door. It was ajar, but couldn’t swing fast enough under such '\n"," 'an impact. It went down flat and slid, and for one crazy moment O’Banion was '\n"," 'riding it like an aquaplane in a sea of fire, for the foyer floor was '\n"," 'ablaze. Then the leading edge of the door caught on something and spilled '\n"," 'him off. He rolled over twice in fuming debris and then got his feet under '\n"," 'him. It was like a particularly bad dream, so familiar, so confusing. He '\n"," 'turned completely around to orient himself, found the corridor, and started '\n"," 'up it, yelling for Sue at the top of his voice. He saw a left-hand wall lean '\n"," 'down toward him and had to scamper back out of the way. It had barely poured '\n"," 'its rubble down when he was on, in, and through it. Over the crash and roar, '\n"," 'over The (Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff 207 his own hoarse bellowing, he '\n"," 'thought he heard a crazy woman laughing somewhere in the fire. Even in his '\n"," 'nearhysteria, he could say, “Not Sue, that’s not Sue Martin. . . And he was, '\n"," 'before he knew it, at and past Sue Martin’s room. He flung out a hand and '\n"," 'caught the door-jamb, which immediately came off in his hand. He bounced off '\n"," 'the end wall and turned as he did so, like a sprint swimmer, and swung into '\n"," 'Sue Martin’s room. “Sue! Sue!” Was he mistaken? Did someone call, '\n"," '“Robin—Robin honey . . .”? He dropped to his knees, where he could see in '\n"," 'relatively clearer air. “Sue, oh Sue!” She lay half buried in rubble from '\n"," 'the fallen ceiling. He threw off scorched and broken two-by-fours and '\n"," 'burning lath, took her by the shoulders and lifted her out of the heap of '\n"," 'broken plaster—thank the powers for that! it had protected her to some '\n"," 'degree. “Sue?” “Robin,” she croaked, j He shook her. “He’s all right, he’s '\n"," 'outside, I saw him.” She opened her eyes and frowned at him. Not at him; at '\n"," 'what he had said. “He’s here somewhere.” “I saw him. Come on!” He lifted her '\n"," 'to her feet, and as she dragged, “It’s the truth; do you think / would lie '\n"," 'to you?” He felt strength surge into her body. “You forgot to say, ‘I, an '\n"," 'O’Banion,’ ” she said, but it didn’t hurt. They stumbled to the window and '\n"," 'he pushed her through it and leaped after her. For two painful breaths they '\n"," 'lay gulping clean air, and then O’Banion got to his feet. His head was '\n"," 'spinning and he almost lay down again. He set his jaw and helped Sue Martin '\n"," 'up. “Too close!” he shouted. Holding her up, he half-dragged her no more '\n"," 'than a step when she suddenly straightened, and with unexpected and '\n"," 'irresistible strength leapt back toward the burning wall, pulling him with '\n"," 'her. He caught at her to regain his balance, and she put her arms tight '\n"," 'around him. “The wall!* he screamed, as it leaned out over them. She said '\n"," 'nothing, but her arms tightened even more, and he could have moved more '\n"," 'easily if he had been bound to a post with steel chains. The wall came down '\n"," 'then, thunder and sparks, like the end of the world; madly, it occurred to '\n"," 'him just then that he could solve one of his problem cases by defining the '\n"," 'unorthodox contract under suit as a stock certificate. 208 Theodore Sturgeon '\n"," 'But instead of dying he took a stinging blow on his right shoulder, and that '\n"," 'was all. He opened his eyes. He and Sue Martin still stood locked together, '\n"," 'and all around them was flame like a flower-bed withthe rough outline of the '\n"," 'house wall and its peaked roof. Around their feet was the four-foot circular '\n"," 'frame of the attic vent, which had ringed them like a quoit. The woman '\n"," 'slumped in his arms, and he lifted her and picked his way, staggering, into '\n"," 'the friendly dark and the welcome hands of the firemen. But when they tried '\n"," 'to lift her away from him she held his arm and would not let go. “Put me '\n"," 'down, just put me down,” she said. “I’m all right. Put me down.” They did '\n"," 'and she leaned against O’Banion. He said, “We’re okay now. We’ll go up to '\n"," 'the road. Don’t mind about us.” The firemen hesitated, but when they began '\n"," 'to walk, they were apparently reassured, and ran back to their work. '\n"," 'Hopeless work, O’Banion amended. But, for a few sagging studs and the two '\n"," 'chimneys, the house was little more than a pit of flames. “Is Robin really—” '\n"," '“Shh. He’s really. Miss Schmidt got him out, I think. Anyway, he’s sitting '\n"," 'on the fire engine Enjoying every minute. He watched you going in. He '\n"," 'approves of your speed.” “You—” “I saw you too. I yelled.” “And then you '\n"," 'came after me.” They walked a slow pace or so. “Why?” , Robin was safe, of '\n"," 'course, he was about to say, so you didn’t have to—and then there was within '\n"," 'him a soundless white flash that lit up all he had ever done and been, '\n"," 'everything he had read, people and places and ideas. Where he had acted '\n"," 'right, he felt the right proven; where he had been wrong, he could see now '\n"," 'the right in full force, even when for years he had justified his wrong. He '\n"," 'saw fully now what §ld Sam Bittelman had almost convinced him of '\n"," 'intellectually with his searching questions. He had fought away Sam’s '\n"," 'suggestion that there was something ludicrous, contradictory about the law '\n"," 'and its pretensions to permanence. Now he saw that the law, as he knew it, '\n"," 'was not under attack at all. As long as a man treated the body of law like a '\n"," 'great The (Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff 209 stone buttress, based in '\n"," 'bedrock and propping up civilization, he was fortifying a dead thing which '\n"," 'could only kill the thing it was built to uphold. But if he saw civilization '\n"," 'as an intricate, moving entity, the function of law changed. It was '\n"," 'governor, stabilizer, inhibitor, control of something dynamic and '\n"," 'progressive, subject to the punishments and privileges of evolution like a '\n"," 'living thing. His whole idea of the hair-splitting search for “precedent” as '\n"," 'a refining process in law was wrong. It was an adaptive process instead. The '\n"," 'suggestion that not one single law is common to all human cultures, past and '\n"," 'present, was suddenly no insult to law at all, but a living compliment; to '\n"," 'nail a culture to permanent laws now seemed as ridiculous a concept as man '\n"," 'conventionally refusing to shed his scales and his gills. And with this '\n"," 'revelation of the viability of man and his works, O’Banion experienced a '\n"," 'profound realignment in his (or was it really his) attitude toward himself, '\n"," 'his effortful preoccupation to defend and justify his blood and breeding and '\n"," 'his gentleman’s place in the world. It came to him now that although the law '\n"," 'may say here that men are born equal, and there that they must receive equal '\n"," 'treatment before the law, no one but a complete fool would insist lhat men '\n"," 'are equal. Men, wherever they came from, whatever they claim for themselves, '\n"," 'are only what’s in their heads and what’s in their hearts. The purest royal '\n"," 'blood that yields a weak king will yield a failure; a strong peasant can '\n"," 'rise higher and accomplish more, and if what he accomplishes is compatible '\n"," 'with human good, he is surely no worse than a beneficent king. Over and '\n"," 'above anything else, however, shone the fact that a good man needs least of '\n"," 'all to prove it by claiming that he comes from a line of good men. And for '\n"," 'him to assume the privileges and postures of the landed gentry after the '\n"," 'land is gone is pure buffoonery. Time enough for sharp vertical '\n"," 'differentiations between men when the differences become so great that the '\n"," 'highest may not crossbreed with the lowest; until then, in the broad view, '\n"," 'differences are so subtle as to be negligible, and the concept “to marry out '\n"," 'of one’s class” belongs with the genesis of hippogriffs and gryphons—in '\n"," 'mythology. All this, and a thousand times more, unfolded and was clear to '\n"," 'O’Banion in this illuminated instant, so short it 210 Theodore Sturgeon took '\n"," 'virtually no time at all, so bright it lit up all the days of his past and '\n"," 'part of his future as well. And it had happened between pace and pace, when '\n"," 'Sue Martin said, “You followed me. Why?” “I love you,” he said instantly. '\n"," '“Why?” she whispered. He laughed joyously. “It doesn’t matter.” Sue '\n"," 'Martin—Sue Martin!—began to cry. XIV Phil Halvorsen opened his eyes and saw '\n"," 'that the house was on fire. He lay still, watching the flames feed, and '\n"," 'thought, isn’t this what I was waiting for? Now there can be an end to it, '\n"," 'he thought peacefully. Now I never need worry again that I’m wrong to be as '\n"," 'I am, and other people’s needs, the appetites and rituals of the great '\n"," 'Average will no longer accuse me. I cannot be excluded unless I exist, so '\n"," 'here’s an end to being excluded. I cannot be looked down on when I can no '\n"," 'longer be seen. The ceiling began to develop a tan patch, and hot white '\n"," 'powder fell frdm it to his face. He covered it with the pillow. He was '\n"," 'resigned to later, final agonies because they would be final, but he saw no '\n"," 'reason to put up with the preliminaries. Just then most of the plaster came '\n"," 'down on him. It didn’t hurt much, and it meant the thing would be over '\n"," 'sooner than he had thought. He heard faintly, over the colossal roaring, a '\n"," 'woman scream. He lay still.- As much as anyone—perhaps more—he would '\n"," 'ordinarily be concerned about the others. But not now. Not now. Such concern '\n"," 'is for a man who expects to live with a conscience afterward. Something—it '\n"," 'sounded like an inside wall—went down very near. It jolted the foot of his '\n"," 'bed and he felt its hot exhalation and the taste of its soot, but otherwise '\n"," 'it did not reach him. “So come on,” he said tightly, “get it over with, will '\n"," 'you?” and hurled the pillow away. As if in direct and obedient answer the '\n"," 'ceiling over him opened up—up; apparently a beam had broken and was tipping '\n"," 'down into an adjoining room, upward here. Then the tangle of stringers it '\n"," 'carried fell away and started down. 211 The (Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff '\n"," 'High above was blackness, suddenly rent by smoky orange light—the inside of '\n"," 'the roof, a section of which was falling in with the stringers. “All right,” '\n"," 'said Halvorsen, as if someone had asked him a question. He closed his eyes. '\n"," 'He closed his eyes on a flash of something like an inner and unearthly '\n"," 'light, and time stood .still ... or perhaps it was only that subjectively he '\n"," 'had all the time in the world to examine this shadowless internal cosmos. '\n"," 'Most immediately, it laid out before him the sequence of events which had '\n"," 'brought him here, awaiting death on a burning bed. In this sequence a single '\n"," 'term smote him with that “well, of course!” revelation that rewarded his '\n"," 'plodding, directive thoughts when they were successful for him. The term was '\n"," '“Average,” and his revelation came like a burst of laughter: for anyone else '\n"," 'this would have been a truism, an inarguable axiom; like a fool he had let '\n"," 'his convoluted thinking breeze past “Average,” use “Average,” worry about '\n"," '“Average” without ever looking at it. But “Average”—Average Appetite—was '\n"," 'here for him to see, a line drawn from side to side on a huge graph. And all '\n"," 'over the graph were spots—millions of them. (He was in a place where he '\n"," 'could actually see and comprehend “millions”.) On that line lived this '\n"," 'creation, this demigod, to whom he had felt subservient for so long, whose '\n"," 'hungers and whose sense of fitness ought to have been—had been—Halvor-sen’s '\n"," 'bench-mark, his reference point. Halvorsen had always felt himself member of '\n"," 'a minority—a minority which shrank as he examined it, and he was always '\n"," 'examining it. All the world catered to Average Man and his “normal” urges, '\n"," 'and this must be proper, for he was aware of the reciprocities: Average Man '\n"," 'got these things because these things were what Average Man wanted and '\n"," 'needed. Want and need . . . and there was the extraordinary discovery he had '\n"," 'made when Bitty asked him: if people really needed it, would there have to '\n"," 'be so much high-pressure salesmanship? This he threw on the graph like a '\n"," 'transparent overlay; it too bore a line from side to side, but much lower '\n"," 'down, indicating with much more accuracy just how interested Average Man was '\n"," 'in the specific appetite about which he made so 212 Theodore Sturgeon much '\n"," 'noise. Now bend close and look at those millions of spots—individual people '\n"," 'all, each with his true need for the kind of cultural pressure which was '\n"," 'driving a man, here, to his death from guilt. The first thing Halvorsen saw '\n"," 'was that the dots were scattered so widely that the actual number falling on '\n"," 'the line Average Man was negligible: there were countless millions more '\n"," 'un-average people. It came to him that those who obey the gospel of Average '\n"," 'Man are, in their efforts to be like the mass of humanity,- obeying the '\n"," 'dictates of one of the smallest minorities of all. The next thing to strike '\n"," 'him was that it took the presence of all these dots to place that line just '\n"," 'where it was; there was no question of better, or worse, or more or less '\n"," 'fit. Except for the few down here and their opposite numbers up there, the '\n"," 'handful of sick, insane, incomplete or distorted individuals whose sexual '\n"," 'appetites were nonexistent or extreme, the vast majority above and below the '\n"," 'true average were basically “normal.” And here where he, Halvorsen might '\n"," 'appear on the graph—he had plenty of company. He’d never known that! The '\n"," 'magazine covers, the advertisements, the dirty jokes—they hadn’t let him '\n"," 'know it. He understood, now, the mechanism of this cultural preoccupation; '\n"," 'it came to him in the recollection that he had appeared at work for three '\n"," 'hundred consecutive working days and nobody noticed his ears. And then one '\n"," 'day a sebaceous cyst in his left lobe had become infected, and the doctor '\n"," 'removed it and he showed up at work with a bandage covering his ear. '\n"," 'Everybody began to think about Halvorsen’s ear! Every interview had to begin '\n"," 'with an explanation of his ear or the applicant would keep straying his '\n"," 'attention to it. And he’d noticed, too, that after he explained about the '\n"," 'cyst, the interviewee would always glance at Halvorsen’s other ear before he '\n"," 'got back to business. Now, in this silver place where all interrelationships '\n"," 'were true ones, he could equate his covered and noticeable ear with a Bikini '\n"," 'bathing suit, and see clearly how normal interest-disinterest—acceptance— '\n"," 'can be put under forced draft. It came to him also why this particular '\n"," 'cultural matrix did this to itself. In its large subconscious, it probably '\n"," 'knew quite clearly the true status of its sensual appetites. It must 213 The '\n"," '(Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff reason, then, that unless it kept these '\n"," 'appetites whipped up to a froth at all times, it might not increase itself, '\n"," 'and it felt it must increase. This was not a pretty thought, but neither is '\n"," 'the pounce of a cat on a baby bird; yet one cannot argue with the drive '\n"," 'behind it. So it was that Halvorsen’s reasons for not living ceased to be '\n"," 'reasons; with the purest of truth he could say I am not unmanned; I am not '\n"," 'unfit; I am not abnormal ... I am not alone. All this in no-time, as he '\n"," 'closed his eyes to await the mass even now falling on him. And the reflex of '\n"," 'reflexes acted just as eyelids met; he spun off the bed, bounced out of the '\n"," 'nearby window, and was on the grass outside as the ceiling and walls '\n"," 'together met the floor in a gout of flame. xv The girl climbed up to the '\n"," 'front seat of the fire engine. “Move over.” Miss Schmidt swung her worried '\n"," 'gaze away from the burning house, and said in a preoccupied tone, “I don’t '\n"," 'think you’d be allowed to, little girl. We’re from that hou—why, it’s Mary '\n"," 'Haunt!” “Didn’t recognize me, huh?” said Mary Haunt. She swung a hip and '\n"," 'shunted Miss Schmidt over. “Can’t say I blame you. What a mess!” she said, '\n"," 'indicating the house. “Mr. O’Banion is in there; he went after Mrs. Martin. '\n"," 'And have you seen Mr. Halvorsen?” “No.” “Tonio! Tonio!” Robin suddenly '\n"," 'cried. “Shh, dear. He’ll be along.” “Dare he iss! Dare he iss! Momee!” he '\n"," 'shrieked, “come see my fire engine, shall we?” “Oh, thank God, thank God '\n"," 'they’re safe,” said Miss Schmidt. She hugged Robin until he grunted. “I’m '\n"," 'all choked up,” growled Mary Haunt. Again she made the angry gesture at the '\n"," 'house. “What a mess. Everything I own—the war-paint, the clothes, all my '\n"," 'magazines —everything, gone. You know what that means. I—” I’ve got to go '\n"," 'home now. And it was here, on the slightest matter of phrasing that the '\n"," 'strange flash of silver suffused 214 Theodore Sturgeon Mary Haunt; not under '\n"," 'the descending scythe of Death, nor under the impact of soul found, heart '\n"," 'found: just for the nudge of a word, she had her timeless instant. All her '\n"," 'life and the meaning of her life and all the things in it: the dimity '\n"," 'curtains and home-baked bread, Jackie and Seth whamming away at each other '\n"," 'for the privilege of carrying her books, the spice-shelf and the daffodils '\n"," 'under the parlor windows. She’d loved it so, and reigned over it; and '\n"," 'mostly, she’d been a gentle princess and ruled kindly. Did they throw you '\n"," 'out, gal? She’d never known where it started, how it came about, until now. '\n"," 'Now, with astonishment, she did. Daddy started it, before she was old enough '\n"," 'to walk, Daddy one of the millions who had applauded a child actress called '\n"," 'Shirley Temple, one of the thousands who had idolized her, one of the '\n"," 'hundreds who had defied her. “Little Mary Hollywood,” he’d called his '\n"," 'daughter, and it had been “When you’re in pictures, honey—” Every morning '\n"," 'was a fountain to empty the reservoir of his dreams; every night he filled '\n"," 'again from the depthless well of his ambition for her. And everyone believed '\n"," 'him. Mom came to believe him, and her kid brother, and finally everyone in '\n"," 'town. They had to; Daddy’s unswerving, undoubting conviction overrode any '\n"," 'alternatives, and she herself clinched it, just by being what she was, an '\n"," 'exquisite child exquisitely gftjomed, who grew more beautiful (by Hollywood '\n"," 'standards) every year. She wanted what every child wants: loving attention. '\n"," 'She got it in fullest measure. She wanted to do what every child wants to '\n"," 'do: gain the approval of her elders. She tried; and indeed, no other course '\n"," 'was open to her. Did they throw you out, gal? Perhaps Daddy might have '\n"," 'outgrown it; or if not, perhaps he’d have known, or found out, how to '\n"," 'accomplish his dream in a real world. But Daddy died when she was six, and '\n"," 'Mom took over his clream as if it had been a flower from his dead hand. She '\n"," 'did not nourish it; she pressed it between the leaves of her treasured '\n"," 'memories of him. It was a live thing, true, but arrested at the intensity '\n"," 'and the formlessness of his hopes for her when she was six. She encouraged '\n"," 'the child only to want to be in pictures, and to be sure she would be; it '\n"," 'never occurred to her that there might be things for the child to The '\n"," '(Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff 215 learn. Her career was coming; it was '\n"," 'coming like Christmas. But no one knew when. And when she cleaned house, '\n"," 'they all thought it was sweet, so pretty to watch, but they’d rather take '\n"," 'the broom away from her; and when she baked, it was pretty too but not what '\n"," 'she was really for; and when she read the diet sections in the grocery '\n"," 'magazines, that was all right, but the other features—how to make tangerine '\n"," 'gravy for duck, how to remove spots from synthetic fibers—“Why, Mary! you’ll '\n"," 'have a little army worrying about those things for you!” Movie magazines '\n"," 'then, and movies, and waiting, until the day she left. Did they throw you '\n"," 'out, gal? Screen Society had a feature on Hollywood High School, and it '\n"," 'mentioned how many stars and starlets had come from there, and the ages some '\n"," 'of them had been when they signed contracts. And suddenly she wasn’t the '\n"," 'Shirley Temple girl at all, she was older, years older than two girls in the '\n"," 'article, the same age as five of them. Yet here she was still, while the '\n"," 'whole town waited . . . suppose she never made it? Suppose nothing happened '\n"," 'here? And she began to interpret this remark, that look, the other silence, '\n"," 'in ways that troubled her, until she wanted to hide, or to drop dead, or '\n"," 'leave. Just like that, leaving was the answer. She told no one, she took '\n"," 'what clothes she had that were good, she bought a ticket for just anywhere '\n"," 'and wrote thrilling, imaginative, untrue letters at wider and wider '\n"," 'intervals. Naively she got a job which might mean her Big Break and which '\n"," 'actually never would. And at last she reached a point where she would not '\n"," 'look back, for wanting home so much; she would not look forward, for knowing '\n"," 'there was nothing there; she held herself in a present of futility and '\n"," 'purposive refusal to further the ambition she insisted ^he had; and she had '\n"," 'no pleasure and no outlet but anger. She took refuge in her furies; she '\n"," 'scorned people and what they did and what they wanted, and told them all so. '\n"," 'And she took the picture of Mom standing in front of the house in the '\n"," 'spring, with the jonquils all about and the tulips coming, and she wrapped '\n"," 'it up in the cotton print Mom had made for her fourteenth birthday and never '\n"," 'given her because Screen Society had said princess-style for teeners was '\n"," 'corny. Did they throw you out, gal? 216 Theodore Sturgeon Old Sam had asked '\n"," 'her that; he knew, even when she didn’t. But now, in this strange silver '\n"," 'moment, she knew; she knew it all. Yes, they had thrown her out. They had '\n"," 'let her be a dead man’s dream until she was nearly dead herself. They never '\n"," 'let her be Mary Haunt who wanted to fix the new curtains and bake a berry '\n"," 'pie, and have a square hedge along the Elm Street side and go to meeting on '\n"," 'Sundays. They had marked her destiny on her face and body and on the clothes '\n"," 'she wore, and stamped it into her speech and fixed her hair the way they '\n"," 'wanted it, and to the bottom of her heart she was angry. And now, all of a '\n"," 'sudden, and for the very first time, it occurred to her that she could, if '\n"," 'she wanted, be Mary Haunt her own self, and be it right there at home; that '\n"," 'home was the best place to be that very good thing, and she could replace '\n"," 'their disappointment with a very real pride. She could be home before the '\n"," 'Strawberry Festival at the church; she would wear an apron and get suds on '\n"," 'her forehead when she pushed her hair back, the way Bitty did sometimes. So '\n"," 'Mary Haunt sat on a fire engine, next to the high-school librarian who was '\n"," 'enveloped in a tremendous raincoat, saying that everything was burned up, '\n"," 'lost; and about to say, “I’ve got to go home now.” But she said, “I can go '\n"," 'home now.” She looked into Miss Schmidt’s eyes and smiled a smile the older '\n"," 'woman had never seen before. “I can, I can! I can go home now!” Mary Haunt '\n"," 'sang. Impulsively she took Miss Schmidt’s hand and squeezed it. She looked '\n"," 'into her face and laughed, “I’m not mad any more, not at you or anybody . . '\n"," '. and I’ve been a little stinker and I’m sorry; \\\\ I’m going home!\" And Miss '\n"," 'Schmidt looked at the smudged face, the scorched hair drawn back into a '\n"," 'childish pony-tail and held by a rubber band, the spotless princess dress. '\n"," '“Why,” said Miss Schmidt, “you’re beautiful, just beautiful!” “I’m not. I’m '\n"," 'seventeen, only seventeen,” Mary Haunt said out of a wild happiness, “and '\n"," 'I’m going home and bake a cake.” And she hugged her mother’s picture and '\n"," 'smiled; even the ruined house did not glow quite this way. EXCERPT FROM '\n"," 'FIELD EXPEDITION (NOTEBOOK) (! ! !) Did it ever work! (You)’d think these '\n"," 'specimens had used Synapse Beta sub Sixteen all their lives! If (we) had a '\n"," '(tenth) as much The (Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff 217 stamina (we) could '\n"," '(lie down) in a (bed) of paradoxes and go to (sleep). (We) will observe for '\n"," 'a (short period) longer, and then pack up and leave. This is a (fascinating) '\n"," 'place to visit, but (I) wouldn’t want to (live) here. XVI It was October, '\n"," 'and possibly the last chance they’d have for a picnic, and the day agreed '\n"," 'and was beautiful for them. They found a fine spot where a stand of birch '\n"," 'grew on both sides of an old split-rail fence, and a brook went by just out '\n"," 'of sight. After, they were finished O’Banion lay on his stomach in the sun, '\n"," 'and thoughtfully scratched his upper lip with a bit of straw. His wife '\n"," 'laughed softly. “Hm?” “You’re thinking about the Bittelmans again.” “How’d '\n"," 'you know?” “Just used to it. When you go off into yourself and look '\n"," 'astonished and mystified and annoyed all at once, it’s the Bittelmans '\n"," 'again.” “Harmless hobby,” said Halvorsen, and smiled. “Is it? Tonio, how '\n"," 'would you like me to go all pouty and coy and complain that you’ve spent '\n"," 'more time thinking about them than about me?” “Do by all means go all pouty '\n"," 'and coy. I’ll divorce you.” “Tony!” “Well,” he said lazily, “I had so much '\n"," 'fun marrying you in the first place that it might be worth doing again. '\n"," 'Where’s Robin?” “Right h— Oh dear. Robin!” Down in the cleft, where the '\n"," 'brook gurgled, Robin’s voice answered instantly. “Frogs here, Mommy. '\n"," 'Deelicious!” “Does he eat ’em raw?” asked Halvorsen mildly. Sue laughed. '\n"," '“That just means ‘pretty’ or ‘desirable’ or even ‘bright green.’ Robin, '\n"," 'don’t you dare get wet, you promise me?” “I promise me,” said the voice. '\n"," '“And don’t go away!” “I don’t.” “Why don’t they show up?” demanded O’Banion. '\n"," '“Just 218 Theodore Sturgeon once, that’s all I’d ever want. Just show their '\n"," 'faces and answer two questions.” “Why don’t who—oh, Sam and Bitty. What two '\n"," 'questions?” “What they did to us, how and why.” .“That’s one question, '\n"," 'counsellor?” asked Halvorsen. “Yes. Two: What they are.” “Now, why’d you say '\n"," '‘what’ instead of ‘who’?” “It comes to that.” He rolled over and sat up. '\n"," '“Honey, would you mind if I ran down everything we’ve found out so far, just '\n"," 'once more?” “Summarize and rest your case?” “I don’t know about resting it . '\n"," '. . reviewing the brief.” “I often wonder why you call it a brief,” '\n"," 'Halvorsen chuckled. O’Banion rose and went to the fence. Putting one hand on '\n"," 'a slender birch trunk, he hopped upward, turning, to come to rest sitting on '\n"," 'the top rail. “Well, one thing I’m sure of: Sam and Bitty could do things to '\n"," 'people, and they did it to all of us. And I refuse to believe that they did '\n"," 'it with logic and persuasion.” “They could be pretty persuasive.” “It was '\n"," 'more than that,” O’Banion said impatiently. “What they did to me changed '\n"," 'everything about me.” “How very intriguing.” “Everything about the way I '\n"," 'think, hussy. I can look back on that now and realize that I was roped, '\n"," 'thrown and notched. When he wanted me to answer questions I had to answer '\n"," 'them, no matter what I was thinking. When he was through with me he turned '\n"," 'me loose and made me go back to my business as if nothing had happened. Miss '\n"," 'Schmidt told me the same thing.” He shifted his weight on the rail and said '\n"," 'excitedly, “Now there’s our prize exhibit. All of us were— changed—by this '\n"," 'thing, but Reta—she’s a really different person.” “She wasn’t more changed '\n"," 'than the other’s,” said Sue soberly. “She’s thirty-eight years old. It’s an '\n"," 'interesting age because when you’re there and look five years older, and '\n"," 'then spruce up the way she did and look five years younger, it looks like '\n"," 'twenty years’ difference, not ten. That’s all cosmetics and clothes, though. '\n"," 'The real difference is as quiet and deep as—well, Phil here.” Again '\n"," 'Halvorsen found a smile. “Perhaps you’re right. The (Widget), The (Wadget) '\n"," 'and Boff 219 She shifted from the library to teaching. It was a shift.from '\n"," 'surrounding herself with other people’s knowledge to surrounding other '\n"," 'people with hers. She’s alive.” “I’ll say. Boyfriend too.” “Quiet and deep,” '\n"," 'said O’Banion thoughtfully, swinging his feet. “That’s right. All you get '\n"," 'out of Halvorsen when you ask him about it is a smile like a light going on '\n"," 'and, ‘Now it’s right for me to be me.’ ” “That’s it—all of it,” chuckled '\n"," 'Halvorsen happily. “And Mary Haunt, bless her. Second happiest child I ever '\n"," 'saw. Robin! Are you all right?” “Yis!” came the voice. “I’m still not '\n"," 'satisfied,” said O’Banion. “I have the feeling we’re staring at very petty '\n"," 'and incidental results of some very important cause. In a moment of acute '\n"," 'stress I made a decision which affected my whole life.” “Our.” He blew her a '\n"," 'kiss. “Reta Schmidt says the same thing, though she wouldn’t go into detail. '\n"," 'And maybe that’s what Halvorsen means when he says, ‘Now it’s right for me . '\n"," '. .* You annoy me.” “Sir!” she cried with mock horror. He laughed. “You know '\n"," 'what I mean. Only you got exposed to the Bittelmans and didn’t change. '\n"," 'Everybody else got wonderful,” he smiled, “Ypu just stayed wonderful. Now '\n"," 'what’s so special about you?” “Must I sit here and be—” “Shush. Think back. '\n"," 'Was there any different kind of thing that happened to you that night, some '\n"," 'kind of emergency thinking you did that was above and beyond anything you '\n"," 'thought you could do?” “Not that I remember.” Suddenly he brought his fist '\n"," 'down on his thigh. “There was! Remember right after we got out of the house, '\n"," 'the wall fell on us? You dragged me back and held me still and that attic '\n"," 'vent dropped right around us?” “That. Yes, I remember. But it wasn’t '\n"," 'special. It just made sense.” “Sense? I’d like to put a computer on that '\n"," 'job—after scorching it half through and kicking it around a while. Somehow '\n"," 'you calculated how fast that thing was falling and how much ground it would '\n"," 'cover when it hit. You computed 220 Theodore Sturgeon that against our speed '\n"," 'outward. You located the attic vent opening and figured where it would land, '\n"," 'and whether or not it could contain us both. Then you estimated our speed if '\n"," 'we went toward the safe spot and concluded that we could make it. Then you '\n"," 'went into action, more or less over my dead body to boot. All that in—” He '\n"," 'closed his eyes to relive the moment. “—all of one and a half seconds '\n"," 'absolute tops. It wasn’t special?” “No, it wasn’t,” she said positively. “It '\n"," 'was an emergency, don’t you see? A real emergency, not only because we might '\n"," 'get hurt, but in terms of all we were to each other and all we could be if '\n"," 'only you—” “Well, I did,” he smiled. “But I still don’t understand you. You '\n"," 'mean you think more, not less—widen your scope instead of narrowing your '\n"," 'focus when it’s that kind of emergency? You can think of all those things at '\n"," 'once, better and faster and more accurately?” Halvorsen suddenly lunged and '\n"," 'caught O’Banion’s foot, pulling it sharply upward. He shouted “Yoop!\" His '\n"," 'right hand whipped up and back and scrabbled at the tree-trunk; his torso '\n"," 'twisted and his left hand shot straight down. His legs flailed and '\n"," 'straightened; for a moment he see-sawed on the rail on his kidneys. At last '\n"," 'he got his left hand on the rail and pulled himself upward to sit again. '\n"," '“Hey! What do you think- you’re—” “Proving a point,” said Halvorsen. “Look, '\n"," 'Tony: without warning you were thrown off balance. What did you do? You '\n"," 'reached out for that tree-trunk without looking—got it, too; you knew just '\n"," 'how fast and how far to go. But at the same time you put your left hand '\n"," 'straight down, ready to catch your weight if you went down to the ground. '\n"," 'Meantime you banged around with your legs and shifted your weight this way '\n"," 'just enough to make a new balance on top. Now tell me: did you sit there '\n"," 'after I pushed you and figure all those things out, one by one?” “By golly '\n"," 'no. Snop—snap—synapses.” “What?” “Synapses. Sort of pathways in the brain '\n"," 'that get paved better and better as you do something over and over. After a '\n"," 'while they happen without conscious thought. Keeping your balance is that '\n"," 'kind of thing, on the motor level. But don’t tell me you have a sort of . . '\n"," '. personal-cultural inner The (Widget), The (Wadget) and Boff 221 '\n"," 'ear—something that makes you react reflectively in terms of your past and '\n"," 'your future and . . . but that’s what happened to me that night!” He stared '\n"," 'at Halvorsen. “You figured that out long ago, you and your IBM head!” “It '\n"," 'always happens if the emergency’s a bad one,” Sue said composedly. '\n"," '“Sometimes when you don’t even know it is an emergency. But what’s '\n"," 'remarkable? Aren’t drowning men supposed to see their whole lives pass '\n"," 'before them?” “Did you say that always happens with your emergencies?” '\n"," '“Well, doesn’t it?” Suddenly he began to chuckle softly, and at her '\n"," 'questioning look he said, “You remind me of something a psychologist told me '\n"," 'once. A man was asked to describe his exact sensations on getting drunk. '\n"," '‘Just like anybody else,’ he says. ‘Well, describe it,’ says the doctor. The '\n"," 'man says, ‘Well, first your face gets a little flushed and your tongue gets '\n"," 'thick, and after a while your ears begin to wiggle—’ Sue, honey, I’ve got '\n"," 'news for you. Maybe you react like that in important moments, a great big '\n"," 'shiny flash of truth and proportional relationships, but believe me, other '\n"," 'people don’t. I never did until that night. Thafs it!” he yelled at the top '\n"," 'of his voice. From down the slope came a clear little voice, “Wash ’at '\n"," 'noice?” Sue and Halvorsen smiled at one another and then O’Ban-ion said '\n"," 'earnestly, “That’s what Bitty and Sam gave us—a synaptic reflex like the '\n"," 'equilibrium mechanisms, but bigger— much bigger. A human being is an element '\n"," 'in a whole culture, and the culture itself is alive ... I suppose the '\n"," 'species could be called, as a whole, a living thing. And when we found '\n"," 'ourselves in a stress situation which was going to affect us '\n"," 'signally—dangerously, or just importantly—we reacted to it in the way I did '\n"," 'just now when you pushed me— only on a cultural level. It’s as if Sam and '\n"," 'Bitty had found a way to install or develop that ‘balancing’ mechanism in '\n"," 'us. It resolved some deep personal conflict of Halvorsen’s; it snapped Mary '\n"," 'out of a dangerous delusion and Miss Schmidt out of a dangerous retreat. '\n"," 'And, well, you know about me.” “I can’t believe people don’t think that way '\n"," 'in emergencies!” she said, dazed. “Maybe some do,” asid Halvorsen. “Come to '\n"," 'think of it, people do some remarkable things under sudden stress; they make '\n"," 'not-obvious but very right choices under pressure, like 222 Theodore '\n"," 'Sturgeon the man who crocks a joke and averts a panic or the boy who throws '\n"," 'himself on a grenade to save his squad. They’ve surveyed themselves in terms '\n"," 'of all they are and measured that against their surroundings and all it '\n"," 'is—all in a split fraction of a second. I guess everyone has it. Some of '\n"," 'it.” “Whatever this synapse is, the Bittelmans gave it to us . . . yes, and '\n"," 'maybe set the house on fire too . . . why? Testing? Testing what—just us, or '\n"," 'human beings? What are they?” demanded „the lawyer. “Gone, that’s what,” '\n"," 'said Halvorsen. For a very brief time, he was wrong to say that. EXCERPT '\n"," 'FROM FIELD EXPEDITION (NOTEBOOK) (Our) last (hour) here, so (we) (induced) '\n"," 'three of -the test specimens to (locus B) for final informal observation.

'\n"," 'We shall now (dismantle) the (widget) and the (wadget) and (take off). Robin '\n"," 'was watching a trout. “Tsst!

Are you a wicked little boy!” “Yis. '\n"," 'Bitty-bitty-BITTY!” “Shh. Look who’s with me.” She put him down, and there '\n"," 'stood old Sam. “Hey-y-y-y, boy?” “Ah Sam!” Robin clasped his hands together '\n"," 'and got them between his knees, bending almost double in delight. “Ware you '\n"," 'been, Sam?” “Around,” said Sam. “Listen, Robin, we came to say goodby. We’re '\n"," 'going away now.” “Don’t go ’way.” “We have to,” said Bitty. She knelt and '\n"," 'hugged him. “Goodby, darling.” “Shake,” said Sam gravely. “Shake, rattle an’ '\n"," 'roll,” said Robin with equal sobriety. “Ready, Sam?” “All set.” Swiftly they '\n"," 'took off their bodies, folded them neatly and put them in two small green '\n"," 'plastic cases. On one was lettered (widget) and on the other (wadget), but '\n"," 'of course Robin was too young to read.

Did you bump your—” He raised a '\n"," 'flushed and contorted face to her. “Boff gone,” he said wetly, “Oh, oh-h-h, '\n"," 'Boff an’ Googie gone.” He cried most of the way home, and never mentioned '\n"," 'Boff again. incidental (notes) on field report: The discovery of total '\n"," 'incidence and random use of Synapse Beta sub Sixteen in a species is unique '\n"," 'in the known (cosmos); yet introduction of the 224 Theodore Sturgeon mass of '\n"," 'data taken on the Field Expedition into the (master) (computer) alters its '\n"," 'original (dictum) not at all: the presence of this Synapse in a species '\n"," 'ensures its survival.
